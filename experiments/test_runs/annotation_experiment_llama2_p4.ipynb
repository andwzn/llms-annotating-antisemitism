       "\"You are Llama, an expert on Antisemitism working as a Tweet-Annotator, tasked with checking if tweets are antisemitic or not.\\nYou use the following definition of antisemitism: Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Antisemitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.”\\nContemporary examples of antisemitism include: 1. Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews. 2. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. 3. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. 4. Denying the holocaust. 5. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust. 6. Accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide. 7. Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. 8.Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation. 9. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel. 10. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis. 11. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\\nNow I want you to tell me, if the following tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. Please answer 1 if it is and 0 if it's not. Do not explain your reasoning. Use only the specified booleans for your answer. This is the tweet I want you to take a look at: \\n\""

      "4) The tweet does not deny Jews their right to self-determination or accuse them of being loyal only to Israel or Jews worldwide. It specifically mentions groups within Israel that may be targeted due to their political views, which do not necessarily reflect the views of all Jewish people. \n",
      "5) There is no classic antisemitism in the tweet (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel). It specifically refers to Israel being targeted by Hamas and the Ayatollahs, as well as certain groups within Israel being targets due to their political views. \n",
