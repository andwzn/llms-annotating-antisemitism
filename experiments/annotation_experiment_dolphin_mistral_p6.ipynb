       "'<|im_start|>system You are Dolphin, an expert on Antisemitism working as a Tweet-Annotator, tasked with checking if tweets are antisemitic or not. You use the following definition of antisemitism: Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Antisemitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for ‚Äúwhy things go wrong.‚Äù Contemporary examples of antisemitism include: 1. Comparing Israel or Jews to the south african apartheid regime. 2.Questioning Israel\\'s legitimacy, history, existence or status as a nationstate. 3. Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews. 4. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. 5. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. 6. Denying the holocaust. 7. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust. 8. Accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide. 9. Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist, fake or an apartheid state. 10.Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation. 9. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel. 11. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis. 12. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.  You might encounter Tweets, that call out antisemitic behavior or other antisemitic tweets. They might cite antisemitic language, but are not in themselves antisemitic and should be classified as not antisemitic (0).  I will provide you with some examples for these kinds of tweets and suitable answers: Tweet 1: \"#BDS#supporters pervasive anti-Semitic rhetoric among boycott supporters that too often equates all things Israel and Jewish with the oppression of Palestinian rights.‚Äú Answer 1: 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic rhetoric among BDS-Supporters. While criticizing said behavior, it cites antisemitic tropes, like blaming jews collectively for the politics of a nation state. But as it is critical toward these ideas, it is not in itself antisemitic. Tweet 2: \"Trump‚Äôs now saying saying AOC +3 are anti-Israel. Just fyi, his pet name for Kusher was ‚ÄòThe Jew‚Äô at ‚ÄòCelebrity Apprentice‚Äô not a joke fyi. @realDonaldTrump\" Answer 2: 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic actions of Donald Trump and points out, that he is not in the position to criticize others politicians antisemitism. While it cites trumps antiseminitc remarks, the tweet is not antisemitic in of itself. Tweet 3: \"@andywartrol @Keir_Starmer @standardnews @JewishChron Oh I do love waking up in the morning and being called a \"zionazi\". Go join Galloways SWGB and leave us Jewish Labour members alone.\" Answer 3: 0. The author of the tweet complains about being called a \"zionazi\". While zionazi is an antisemitic term, it is in this case not used to attack or demonize jews, but to call out the antisemitism of others. The tweet is thereby not antisemitic. <|im_end|> <|im_start|>user Now I want you to tell me, if the following tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. Please answer 1 if it is and 0 if it\\'s not and briefly explain your reasoning. This is the tweet I want you to take a look at: '"

      "Row 551: [1] 0. This tweet does not target or demonize Jews or the Jewish people as a collective; instead, it criticizes terrorism and highlights that people of various religions have been victims of violence. Although the author includes \"Jews kill me in Palestine\" among other examples, this statement is part of an overarching message against terrorism rather than being antisemitic. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, the tweet does not fall under that category and should be considered not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 552: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target, attack or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions based on their Jewish identity. Instead, it points out that certain individuals (referred to as \"anti-racists\" and \"tribalism supporters\") seem to prioritize their own groups over Jews in specific instances. While the term \"throwing Jews under the bus\" might be perceived as antagonistic towards Jews, it is not using any traditional antisemitic tropes or ideas; rather, it's critiquing certain individuals for allegedly prioritizing their group interests over those of Jewish individuals. Therefore, the tweet itself can be considered non-antisemitic even though it discusses the relationship between a particular group and Jews.\n",
      "Row 553: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or any dehumanizing remarks about them.

      "Row 554: [0] 0. According to the definition provided, this tweet does not appear to be antisemitic in nature. While it references \"Jews,\" there is no context of hatred or demonization towards them. It seems more like a metaphorical reference rather than an expression of hatred or antisemitism.

      "Row 560: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. The author criticizes media attention on a supposed issue concerning democrats and their perceived hatred of Jews rather than promoting it themselves.

      "Row 567: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism. The focus here is on circumcision as a physical trait associated with Jews, but it does not express hatred toward Jews or promote any negative stereotypes about them.

The tweet highlights that President Trump's statement about Jews who vote for Democrats shows \"either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\" is an example of bigotry and anti-Semitism. It does not target Jews with hatred, but instead criticizes the bigoted remark made by Trump, which alludes to old stereotypes that Jews are only loyal to Israel and not their home countries. The tweet itself isn't antisemitic because it doesn't demonize or dehumanize Jews. Instead, it calls out the antisemitic aspects of Trump's statement.\n",

      "Row 576: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them directly. It mentions the CEO of Media Matters as being \"a Nazi who hates Jews and their ‚ÄúJew bags of gold.‚Äù\" However, this criticism is directed at the individual (the CEO) rather than Jewish people collectively, thus it doesn't fit into category 3 (calling for or justifying the harming of Jews), which would classify as antisemitic.

This tweet criticizes the Corbyn's Labour party for allegedly encouraging hatred towards Jews and recognizes that antisemitism could potentially manifest even from individuals who may not mean to promote it, indicating an awareness of unintended or systemic prejudice within political institutions.

This tweet criticizes Al Sharpton's past antisemitic remarks and highlights the contradiction of Democratic candidates speaking at his convention after previously avoiding an event organized by AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and siding with Ilhan Omar, who has faced criticism for her own history of making antisemitic comments.

The tweet's main focus is on the author's disapproval of a specific campaign conducted by this organization and its perceived manipulation of a cancer-affected individual.

The association with \"the Nazis\" and labeling someone as \"dangerous\" due to their perceived view of Jews can be seen as antisemitic, as it demonizes Omar and draws an inaccurate parallel to the Nazis' hateful actions toward Jews. However, the tweet primarily criticizes Omar for her alleged stance on Jews rather than explicitly expressing hatred towards Jews itself. Hence, according to the definition of antisemitism I have been given, it may be classified as 1, but with a note that it is more about criticizing another person (Omar) for allegedly having anti-Jewish views and less about directly promoting hate against Jews. This nuanced understanding aligns closely with the provided guidelines, which state that \"rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals [...] However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\" The tweet doesn't express hatred towards Jews, but it uses a comparison with the Nazis' treatment of Jews in an attempt to discredit Omar. This comparison might lead some readers into thinking that the author is implying the same level of danger and anti-Jewish sentiment from Omar, which may be seen as antisemitic, albeit indirectly.\n",

While the tweet cites antisemitic ideas and brings up concerning connections, it ultimately serves as a warning against the potential dangers of embracing QAnon within the Republican Party.

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, even though it does contain potentially inflammatory language towards religious beliefs, particularly Christianity and Judaism.

This tweet criticizes Keir Starmer's handling of a situation involving Rebecca Long-Bailey and claims it is an example of antisemitism according to the code Labour signed up to.

      "Row 916: [0] 0. This tweet does not display any antisemitic rhetoric or actions. While it mentions that the author's grandparents were Jews and refers to historical events (the Holocaust), it is not accusing, blaming, or demonizing Jewish people or Israel.

It does not fall into any of the categories outlined in the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 917: [1] 0. The tweet refers to an individual named \"Lipman,\" and questions whether this person owes more allegiance to another nation than the one in which he lives. While questioning someone's loyalty can sometimes be interpreted as antisemitic, especially if it targets a Jewish person collectively without any evidence or context, this tweet specifically addresses Lipman, an individual.

The definition of antisemitism does not specify any religion as inherently antisemitic, and it's crucial to understand that conflating antisemitism with a specific faith or nation is inaccurate. Antisemitism is prejudice or hatred against Jewish people or those perceived as being Jewish, regardless of their actual religious beliefs. While the tweet mentioned contains negative language about a particular religion (Islam), it does not specifically target or express hatred towards Jews or any individual or group that identifies as Jewish. Instead, the statement appears to make an incorrect and inflammatory generalization regarding one religion's alleged intent towards another community rather than directly accusing or inciting hate against Jews. As a result, the tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",

The content is a verse from the Al-Qur'an which addresses the relationships between different religious groups but does not target or demonize Jews specifically as required by the definition of antisemitism provided.

      "Row 930: [0] 0. The tweet compares people who support politicians with questionable actions (similar to Hitler in this case) and who deny being antisemitic, to the situation of Germans in the 1930s.

The intention here appears to be pointing out the hypocrisy and contradictory nature of the position taken by those who deny being antisemitic while also supporting politicians with questionable actions towards Jewish people.

The statement criticizes a particular behavior (Islamophobia) within a group of individuals who identify as Jews and does not target the whole Jewish community.

It simply questions why only Nick Cannon was fired compared to others who might have shared controversial opinions about different racial groups.

It draws a historical parallel between the slow process of dehumanization that led to the Holocaust and the gradual progression of tyranny, illustrating the dangers of good intentions gone awry.

It appears to be more about media representation and choice of language rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or any other community.\n",
      "Row 994: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitism. It refers to the user's grandparents being Jews and mentions that they were sent to camps due to their religious affiliation during a historically significant time.

It criticizes the user's interlocutor @chatpataka100 for spreading hate towards non-Muslims instead.

      "- Secondly, it suggests that people of other races can replace or take the place of Jewish individuals, which denies their distinct identities and experiences.\n",

      "Row 999: [0] 0. While this tweet does mention \"Jews\" and might appear to be criticizing them, it is not using hateful or stereotypical language commonly associated with antisemitism. The context implies that the person being referred to as \"Jews\" is Ben Shapiro, a public figure who identifies as Jewish. Furthermore, the tweet appears to be referring sarcastically to a news report about Ben Shapiro catering to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rather than promoting hate or antisemitic ideas. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1000: [1] 0. The tweet does not explicitly express hatred or harm toward Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions. It mentions \"jews\" in the context that they might be manipulating others (goym) for some unknown purpose (\"NWO\"). However, this tweet is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. Without more context, it's hard to definitively label the tweet as antisemitic. It does not align perfectly with the definition of antisemitism provided but also doesn't fall squarely into criticism of Israel or Zionism, which isn't considered antisemitic either. Therefore, according to this specific definition and context, it should be classified as not antisemitic (0). However, the phrasing \"jews are using all of us goyim\" may still be seen by some as negative or stereotypical, thus bordering on antisemitism, but without more context, it's not categorically antisemitic. It would help to have a broader understanding of what the author means by \"NWO\", \"order through chaos\", and how they associate it with Jews in order to make a clearer judgement about whether this tweet is antisemitic or not.\n",
      "Row 1001: [0] 0. This tweet questions the actions of some individuals who may be Jewish, and it does so in a manner that could potentially be interpreted as an accusation or stereotype about Jews pursuing \"world domination.\" However, the tone is more inquisitive rather than overtly antisemitic.

      "Row 1002: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism according to the given guidelines. The content of the tweet refers to Sabbath in a religious context, acknowledging that there may be Jews who do not observe it.

      "Row 1003: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It discusses a disagreement between British Jews who signed a petition against an \"Ambassador\" and their views on the Ambassador's stance. The Board of Deputies (BoD) is mentioned as having a different perspective, which prompts the author's curiosity. The tweet does not target all Jews or the Jewish community as a whole with negative stereotypes or accusations. Instead, it highlights differences within the British Jewish community and questions how representative the BoD is of the entire Jewish population in Britain.\n",
      "Row 1004: [1] 0. The tweet does not demonize or target Jewish people with hatred, but rather challenges the notion of Zionist control and implies hypocrisy in its absence. It criticizes an argument that involves the role of Jews, but it is not expressing antisemitic rhetoric itself. Therefore, it's not classified as antisemitic according to the given definition. The tweet highlights a perceived contradiction or inconsistency within the concept of Zionist control rather than promoting hate or prejudice against Jewish individuals or their community.\n",
      "Row 1005: [1] 0. This tweet appears to criticize the United Nations for not equally addressing the rights of different groups, specifically mentioning Muslims, but then it refers to the UN as \"Dogs\" of Jews and Americans. The phrasing may be inarticulate and might lead some to interpret it as an attack on Jews, which could potentially be perceived as antisemitic. However, this tweet is primarily addressing a perceived issue with the United Nations rather than expressing hatred towards Jewish people or promoting conspiracy theories targeting them. Therefore, while problematic due to its phrasing, it does not meet the strict definition of antisemitism provided by the European Union's working definition and should be classified as 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 1006: [1] 0. The tweet does not display hatred towards Jews, nor does it use stereotypical, demonizing, or dehumanizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.

      "Row 1008: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or sentiment towards Jews. It's merely a hypothetical scenario presented by the user and provokes thoughts on how one would react in such a situation, implying that denying the Holocaust is indicative of being an \"unapologetic anti-Semite.\" In this context, there is no explicit hatred or harm intended towards Jewish people. The tweet encourages reflection upon attitudes that can be identified as antisemitic but does not constitute those same attitudes itself.\n",
      "Row 1009: [1] 1. The tweet \"...the jews declared war on germany!\" is antisemitic, as it falsely and maliciously attributes collective responsibility to all Jews for a specific historical event (World War II) which was orchestrated by the German government and Nazi regime, not Jews. It also demonstrates an understanding of Jews in the same light as the stereotype that has persisted throughout history, attributing sinister intent and actions to them collectively rather than individuals. Such language can lead to discrimination, hatred, and violence towards Jewish people.

      "Row 1010: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism provided, though it might appear to criticize anti-Semitic ideas related to Karl Marx and Communism. The author of this tweet is arguing that anti-Semitism existed before Karl Marx and continued throughout his life, and it wasn't merely a result of Marxist ideology. They also assert that the motivation for this violence was not due to political philosophy but rather hatred towards Jews. Though it brings up historical instances of antisemitic violence related to both Jews and Karl Marx, it is critical of those who perpetuate these actions, rather than being an endorsement or incitement of them. Therefore, according to the definition given, this tweet should not be categorized as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1011: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any of the characteristics mentioned in the definition of antisemitism provided.

It refers to Jewish people who have turned away from Talmudic tradition, but it does not express hatred or hostility toward them.

Although the tweet refers to \"Talmudic tradition\" and mentions Jews, it is discussing religious views in a historical context rather than using it as an attack against Jewish people or promoting hatred towards them.

It merely discusses Sheldon Adelson, who is an individual Jew and a donor to Trump and Republicans, without making any generalizations about Jews or Judaism as a whole. The fact that the person being quoted referred to \"Adelson\" and not \"Jews\" indicates that this tweet does not fall into the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",

This event has nothing to do with any modern-day prejudices against Jews and therefore does not fall into the category of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1025: [0] 0. Although this tweet does discuss the suffering of Jewish people during the Holocaust, it is not directly antisemitic. The main focus here appears to be a discussion regarding a quote from Kerry-Anne Mendoza and whether she was specifically referring to Jews or other victims. While the context involves discussing a historical event related to the persecution of Jewish people by the Nazis (Auschwitz and \"Arbeit macht frei\"), it does not exhibit hatred, demonization, or dehumanization towards Jewish individuals or the Jewish community as a whole, which are key elements in antisemitic rhetoric. Thus, according to the provided definition, this tweet should be considered non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1026: [0] 0. This tweet calls out racism from various communities including the Arabs, Jews, Indians, and Chinese towards Black people. While it does not shy away from acknowledging that these groups have also demonstrated hatred towards Black individuals, it is not inciting hate or making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about any of these groups specifically.

It is discussing the issue of lockdowns and governmental control during a pandemic, specifically mentioning Haredi Jews as a group that could potentially require stricter guidelines due to their religious congregations. While some might argue that focusing on one particular group might be perceived as unfair or unjust, it does not fit within the definition of antisemitism provided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition.

The tweet is not antisemitic in itself, as it appears to be discussing a historical figure (likely referring to Count Folke Bernadotte) who was indeed of German descent and was assassinated by Zionist paramilitary members. However, this does not involve any stereotypical or demonizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews collectively. The tweet simply makes a factual statement about the person's nationality and cause of death, but it should be noted that referring to all Jews as responsible for the assassination would be problematic. Here, we don't see an overarching attempt to demonize or vilify Jewish people generally; rather, the tweet appears to refer to a specific historical event, not a generalized, sweeping statement about Jews.

      "Row 1039: [1] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic because it does not display hatred towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions with rhetorical or physical manifestations of hate.

The reference to 'hatred of whites, Jews, and America' is not antisemitic in itself but rather a generalized criticism towards the Democrats, which does not meet the criteria of the definition provided.

It criticizes the idea of American Jews telling Israel what it needs or does not need, implying that they may lack a full understanding of Israeli security concerns because they are not living in the country and facing the same threats. However, this critique is not based on hatred toward Jewish people but rather a disagreement about who should determine Israel's security measures.

While it references Hitler and his persecution of Jews, the tweet itself is not antisemitic as it does not contain any hatred or harmful rhetoric toward Jewish people or Israel. Instead, it highlights the issue of allowing disputed claims about Jews on the platform and serves to raise awareness and concern over this matter.\n",
      "Row 1156: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism as it criticizes a comparison made by \"some scholars\" between Hindutva and Nazis, as well as Muslims in Germany to Jews. While there may be issues with these comparisons, the tweet itself is not promoting hatred or targeting Jewish individuals or institutions. It is instead pointing out that such comparisons are flawed because Hindutva encourages unity among different communities while the Nazis fostered division and animosity between different groups.\n",
      "Row 1157: [0] 1. The tweet contains clear antisemitic content by comparing the actions of Hitler towards Jews to those of Mohammed. It suggests that the latter's actions are acceptable as \"peaceful hate and murder,\" which is a deeply offensive statement and perpetuates negative stereotypes about Islam while dehumanizing Jewish people. This tweet promotes hatred toward Jews and thus can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1158: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it does not express hatred towards Jews or target individuals or their property, institutions, or religious facilities. It merely presents a viewpoint about the ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews that challenges common beliefs and asks whether someone who holds this belief may be considered an antisemite. This tweet can be seen as a critique of certain views rather than promoting hatred or prejudice towards Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 1159: [0] 0. The tweet appears to reference an antisemitic trope by mentioning \"the Jews,\" but it doesn't express hatred, endorse any specific belief or action against Jewish people, or target the Jewish community. Instead, the statement seems more like an out-of-context joke or a sarcastic expression that does not conform to the definition of antisemitism provided. Therefore, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1160: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user is referring to a specific person (possibly a leader or prominent figure) who they imply might be \"urging\" people to leave, but does not specifically target Jews with negative connotations, such as stereotyping, demonization, or blame for societal ills. Instead, the tweet appears to question the legitimacy of an allegation made by another user without adopting antisemitic language or tropes.\n",
      "Row 1161: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it falsely accuses Christians of turning a \"blind eye\" while Jews were being persecuted during the Holocaust and perpetuates historical inaccuracies about the role of the Pope and Christianity during this time period. The statement also promotes a false equivalence between Judaism and Christianity, which can contribute to antisemitic attitudes and beliefs. Additionally, it denies or downplays Christian involvement in fighting against the Holocaust by implicating them as passive bystanders rather than rescuers, thus ignoring historical facts that contradict this narrative.\n",
      "Row 1162: [1] 0. While this tweet discusses Soros' alleged actions during the Holocaust, it does not specifically target Jews or the Jewish community as a whole. The focus of the statement is on accusing one individual (Soros) of past wrongdoings and expressing an opinion about him.

      "Row 1163: [1] 0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or their practices with hatred or demonization. It uses humor by referring to the speaker's relatives as potentially \"murderous\" due to their association with an unrelated event involving a phone in Palestine.

      "Row 1164: [0] 0: This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or language according to the provided definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 1165: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to contain antisemitic language or intent towards Jews or Israel. The author of the tweet is referencing a story from the Old Testament, specifically the story of Moses leading the Jewish people out of Egypt and the subsequent hardships they faced at the hands of Pharaoh. It seems like a critique of that story rather than an attack on Jews or Judaism. So it does not meet any of the criteria for antisemitic content according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1166: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not target Jews or Jewish community institutions and religious facilities with hatred or manifestations of hostility. Instead, it compares the freedom of belief in Islamic countries to other religions like Christianity, Hinduism, and Judaism, while also addressing the issue of religious freedom for Muslims within those societies. While some could interpret this as a general criticism of religious practices within certain regions, it does not specifically target or demonize Jews.\n",
      "Row 1167: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews, nor is it an antisemitic manifestation directed toward individuals or their property, Jewish community institutions, religious facilities, or even the state of Israel. It is sharing a somewhat awkward situation involving a roommate who left a pamphlet related to ministering to Jews in their shared dormitory space. While the fact that the person found it strange and humorously reacted does not make it inherently antisemitic. There are no accusations, stereotypical allegations, or blaming of Jews for any wrongdoing. It simply is sharing an interesting (and somewhat amusing) personal story about a roommate's actions which may have been seen as insensitive but is not a manifestation of hatred or antisemitism itself.\n",
      "Row 1168: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided. The tweet discusses a specific issue, focusing on the fact that \"blacks killing blacks\" is perceived as a family issue rather than a poverty issue. While it may be viewed as insensitive or lacking sensitivity to various issues faced by different communities, it does not directly target Jewish people with hatred, stereotyping, or demonization, nor does it specifically blame Jewish people for the situation of African Americans. As such, it falls under the category of \"not in itself antisemitic\" according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1169: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them with antisemitic rhetoric. Instead, it refers to a joke made by a renowned Jewish comedian, Mel Brooks, about Nazis, and implies that the outrage is misguided and perhaps hypocritical given the humorous context provided by Brooks. It is not in itself an example of antisemitism or hate speech towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 1170: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them with any manifestations of antisemitism as described in the definition provided. The author is questioning whether \"bullying individual Jews\" is helpful, but this doesn't imply they are bullying Jews themselves or endorsing such behavior. They could be discussing others' actions against Jews and expressing doubts about its effectiveness. Without more context, it would be incorrect to categorize the tweet as antisemitic. It may not be a particularly strong or well-constructed argument, but there is no evidence in this single tweet that it is inherently hateful or intends harm towards Jews or Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 1171: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, because it makes dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective (point #4 in the definition). The text insinuates that Jews control governments around the world and destroy those who do not cooperate. This type of statement is commonly used to blame Jews for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by individuals or groups, which fits the profile of antisemitic rhetoric as defined here.\n",
      "Row 1172: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition. The author expresses concern over the lack of knowledge about the Holocaust within America's youth and highlights the importance of education regarding this historical event. While it does mention the Holocaust, which was a genocide targeting Jews specifically, it does not promote hatred, demonize or stereotype Jews or Judaism, nor does it compare Israel to Nazis or the South African apartheid regime, which are all aspects that could lead to an antisemitic classification. Instead, the author is highlighting the responsibility of the educational system to provide accurate and important information about historical events like the Holocaust.\n",
      "Row 1173: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote or express antisemitic ideas towards Jews or Israel; instead, it criticizes the behavior of a particular political party (Labour) and its leader for banning some Jewish members from participating in discussions about Jewish issues due to their affiliations. Furthermore, the tweet highlights the use of offensive stereotypes (Shylock, Fagin) against Jewish Tories as another instance of antisemitism within that same party. By denouncing such actions and calling them \"antisemitic,\" this tweet is not promoting or propagating antisemitism itself.\n",
      "Row 1174: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes and does not target Jews or Jewish individuals negatively. The user is expressing their disdain towards Nazis and their atrocities. While the mention of Jews in relation to Holocaust victims might evoke memories of antisemitism, it is within a broader context of criticizing Nazis for their actions against various groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses and gays. Therefore, this tweet does not fit any of the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1175: [0] 0. This tweet calls out the act of equating Israel with all Jewish people, which is a common antisemitic trope that blames Jews collectively for the actions of a nation state.

As such, it is not in itself antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1176: [1] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic. It mentions Jews and Muslims in the context of fighting, which while not ideal, does not demonize or dehumanize any specific group.

This interpretation aligns with the guidelines on what is considered antisemitic and what isn't, as it doesn't fit the definition of antisemitism provided in the given text.\n",
      "Row 1177: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or language according to the definition provided. It is merely addressing the difference between religious and ethnic aspects of Judaism, and providing an explanation about conversion.

      "Row 1178: [0] 0. While this tweet cites religious aspects of Judaism and references the Jewish belief in being God's chosen people, it does not express hatred toward Jews or promote antisemitic ideas. It appears to be a playful banter rather than an expression of antisemitism. The person writing the tweet acknowledges that referencing the Bible could potentially cause controversy but proceeds with their remark in a lighthearted manner. This tweet is not a serious attempt to dehumanize, demonize or stereotype Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions with hatred or violence.\n",
      "Row 1179: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language or express hatred towards Jews specifically. It is a broad statement that people dislike others for various reasons, including race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and accent.

The tweet does not demonize, blame, or target Jews or Jewish institutions; instead, it questions the authenticity of certain people's claims to a particular identity. While it may seem critical or dismissive, there is no clear indication of hatred towards Jews or any intent to dehumanize or stereotype them based on their religion or ethnic background. Therefore, it does not fit into the definition of antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 1181: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic content itself as it merely discusses a hypothetical situation in Nazi Germany involving a book withdrawing blame of Jews for the holocaust. It is critical of a perceived censorship, rather than attacking or demonizing Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 1182: [0] 0. This tweet does not explicitly express hatred toward Jews or use antisemitic language to target Jewish individuals or their property. The author criticizes the unfair treatment of white Americans due to the belief that they are latent Nazis, and cites America's help to the Jews during WW2 as an example. Although it contains a reference to Jews (the \"good deed\" of bailing them out), this tweet does not fit any of the criteria for antisemitism mentioned in the definition provided. It is rather a critique on unfair prejudices and the idea that white Americans are treated with suspicion due to perceived latent Nazi tendencies, which is unrelated to Jews or Judaism.\n",
      "Row 1183: [0] 0. The tweet appears to counter an assertion that could potentially be antisemitic (for example, if it was implying that all people who share the political stance of Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump are Jewish), but it does not include any stereotypical or negative references to Jews. It simply asserts that \"Not all Jews\" fall into the category being discussed. While the phrase \"Not all Jews\" can sometimes be a defensive response to antisemitism, it doesn't inherently express hatred toward Jews or target them in a negative way.

      "Row 1184: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the definition provided. The author discusses the Second World War's genocide of Jews and emphasizes the defencelessness they faced during that time, but also highlights how Jewish people empowered themselves in a following part of their message. It seems more like a reference to their work (a film) rather than an attack or demonization against Jews. Although mentioning the Holocaust, it does not meet any of the 12 mentioned points of antisemitism in the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1185: [0] 0. This tweet does not target or demonize Jewish individuals or groups but rather critiques the actions and behavior of Trump that are perceived as negligent, leading to harm and death. The reference to Hitler and the Holocaust is being used to emphasize a point about Trump's lack of empathy and responsibility for his decisions, which does not amount to antisemitic language or intent. The user expresses guilt over not having more empathy but also states that the murder of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust warrants wishing harm upon Hitler. The comparison between the Holocaust and Trump's negligence is a critique of Trump, not an attack on Jewish individuals or community.\n",
      "Row 1186: [0] 0. This tweet does not display any hatred or prejudice towards Jews.

It criticizes Russia for their actions in history, specifically mentioning their deportation of Jews.

      "Row 1189: [1] 1. This tweet contains numerous antisemitic tropes, such as accusing Jews of controlling various industries across the world, including film, cinema, textile, and the cotton trade.

The language used in this tweet is clearly targeted at demonizing and dehumanizing Jewish individuals collectively, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1190: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or rhetoric and is merely providing historical context regarding the Negev Desert during the period after the United Nations Partition Plan in 1947 and before the establishment of Israel as a state.

      "Row 1192: [0] 0. The tweet criticizes the promotion of white supremacy and mass murder of six million Jews, which is a historical fact regarding the Holocaust.

The user is addressing Ari Fleischer with a playful tone, expressing their disagreement or dissatisfaction with his actions and implying that he should seek support from another group. While it may carry a negative connotation, this tweet does not involve hatred towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals, institutions, or the State of Israel through any of the listed methods in the definition.

It criticizes Democratic actions during the pandemic and implies distrust towards Biden, but it does not specifically target Jews or make any hateful claims against them based on their ethnicity or religion.

      "Row 1199: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it calls out the incorrect assumption that all Jews are responsible for the I/P conflict and argues against holding every Jew responsible for it. It points out that the person is an American Jew, asserting their lack of direct influence over Israeli governmental decisions. Therefore, it does not express hatred toward Jews or blame them collectively for any wrongdoings committed by a single Jew or non-Jew.

      "Row 1224: [1] 1. This tweet does contain antisemitic elements, as it accuses both political sides (Trump and Biden) of being equally evil and controlled by the \"Jews lobby.\" This statement not only demonizes Jews but also suggests that they are secretly influencing events in a way that is harmful to others. This falls under the category of making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective, which according to the provided definition, would be considered antisemitic.\n",

      "3. By making this comparison, it implies that German POWs have experienced similar levels of suffering and persecution as Jewish people during the Holocaust, which is a false equivalence that minimizes the unique atrocities committed against Jews.

First, it asserts that \"Jews are not the real children of Israel,\" which is an attempt to deny Jewish people their rightful connection to the history and identity associated with Israel. This claim is used to discredit and delegitimize Jewish people's historical claims and religious beliefs, thereby promoting antisemitic ideology. Secondly, it accuses Jews of \"extorting America,\" which is a stereotypical allegation about Jews having too much economic influence and using their power in an unfair or harmful way. This accusation perpetuates the trope that Jews control financial systems and other aspects of society, which is a common antisemitic stereotype.\n",
      "Row 1235: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not contain any hateful or prejudiced content towards Jews.

The question about the candidates' position on apartheid in Israel/Palestine is a legitimate topic of discussion, as it concerns human rights issues within this conflict zone.

It casually references \"the extermination of the Jews,\" which evokes memories and pain associated with the Holocaust, an event that was perpetrated by the Nazi regime, a regime explicitly mentioned in the tweet as a system of which Hitler was a part (\"Also Hitler was a National SOCIALIST\").

      "2. It goes on to insinuate that the target is \"missing from their village,\" implying that they don't belong, suggesting an element of exclusion or otherness which are typical antisemitic tropes. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The term \"moron\" alongside a Holocaust reference can be perceived as belittling the gravity and historical significance of the atrocity that was committed against Jews during World War II.

      "\n",
      "4. The statement \"Your a moron\" combined with the reference to Hitler and Nazis has elements of blame or accusation that are typically associated with antisemitism - it's accusing someone of being on par with those who committed genocide against Jews, implying that they may carry similar traits or intentions.\n",

      "Row 1325: [0] 0: The tweet calls out anti-Zionist rhetoric as a form of antisemitism and advocates for its eradication from certain spaces, such as unions, demos, and campus environments. Although it uses the term \"Jews\" to exemplify the comparison with dogs, the intention is not to demonize or dehumanize Jews but to express disapproval of these exclusionary attitudes. Thus, while the tweet alludes to historical anti-Semitic practices, its primary aim is not to perpetuate hate against Jewish people but rather to criticize and combat such rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 1326: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition, as it acknowledges and honors Holocaust Remembrance Day by mentioning that 6 million Jews were among the victims of the Nazi regime alongside other groups.

The focus here is on redemption and the idea that God wants to redeem the people from wrath, which does not fit into the categories you've provided for antisemitic behavior.

Instead, it expresses a sense of historical injustice and contrasts the eradication of Nazi symbols to their continued celebration in India. It highlights disparities between the treatment of historical sites for each group rather than promoting antisemitic ideas.\n",
      "Row 1358: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or advocate violence against Jewish individuals, institutions, or their property. Instead, it questions the historical account of the Holocaust and challenges the number of Jews who were systematically slaughtered. It is critical of certain sources and presents alternative information. While questioning the Holocaust can be antisemitic in some contexts, this tweet does not contain any explicit or implicit antisemitic tropes or stereotypes that target Jewish people. It focuses on historical facts rather than blaming Jews for any wrongdoing.\n",
      "Row 1359: [0] 0. The given tweet does not contain any antisemitic language, nor is it expressing hatred towards Jews. It simply states a historical fact about the Jewish community's involvement and support of civil rights movements and the African National Congress (ANC). While some might argue that questioning the loyalty or goodwill of Jews could be considered as borderline antisemitism, this particular tweet does not contain any such elements. Instead, it highlights an important part of the Jewish history and their contributions to significant social justice movements. Hence, it can be classified as non-antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1360: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic, as it does not target or demonize Jewish people directly. Instead, it compares the experiences of Indian South Africans to those of Irish immigrants in the US and alludes to a historical transformation in their social standing. While it may use offensive language towards other ethnicities (not explicitly targeting Jews), it is not using antisemitic rhetoric or tropes as described in the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1361: [0] 0. This tweet does not display antisemitism as it is criticizing the blame placed on Black Jews for experiencing antisemitism, which is a contradictory statement in itself. The user also expresses frustration with racism within the community and emphasizes their experience of antisemitism. While they use the term \"antisemitic,\" it is clear that they are opposing this behavior, not promoting it.\n",
      "Row 1362: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes and is instead suggesting that Muslims had a significant role in saving Jews during specific historical events, such as during the Holocaust. While it may not be a perfect comparison due to various reasons, the intent of the tweet is not to demean or demonize Jewish people or their history.\n",
      "Row 1363: [0] 0. Although the tweet compares Malaysians to ancient Jews and mentions a specific belief that some people consider antisemitic (the reference to an \"Imam of Pigs\" which could be referencing an outdated stereotype), it doesn't express hatred towards Jewish individuals or groups, nor is it targeting any Jewish institution or community. The tweet appears to praise the efforts of Malaysians and show respect for their struggle without using these comparisons as a form of slander or demonization against Jews or Judaism. It is also essential to consider the broader context of this tweet, which may not carry an explicit antisemitic message. The phrase \"Imam of Pigs\" is often used in certain cultures to describe corrupt individuals or leaders and does not necessarily imply any religious bigotry towards Islam. Therefore, based on the definition provided, the tweet would be considered NOT antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1364: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it merely informs non-Jewish people about important Jewish days that they might consider avoiding when scheduling events or tasks. It does not demonize, stereotype, or harm Jews in any way; rather, it promotes sensitivity and understanding towards one's colleagues with diverse religious backgrounds.\n",
      "Row 1365: [0] 0. The tweet is critical towards certain individuals referred to as \"the worst culprits,\" expressing that they are \"disgusting hypocrites.\" It doesn't demonstrate hatred towards Jews or stereotype them based on the Torah, and it does not target Jewish individuals or institutions with violence or dehumanizing language. Instead, it calls out certain individuals for their actions and suggests consulting the Torah, which is a central text in Judaism. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1366: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes Al Sharpton's participation in a \"KILL THE JEWS\" parade, which is a clear reference to antisemitic actions and events. While the language used is strong and may be perceived as offensive, the tweet itself does not target or demonize Jewish people. The author is using this example of Al Sharpton's participation in the event to express their disdain for such hate-driven gatherings. In that sense, it is not in itself antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1367: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It criticizes Iran for promoting violence against Jews, but does not demonize or dehumanize Jews or make stereotypical allegations about them as a group. The comparison it makes between credible and certified doctors sharing \"good news\" about saving lives from the Chinese Virus is also unrelated to antisemitism. It highlights an issue of freedom of speech, which falls under the category of not being inherently antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1368: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or language. It references a religious aspect from both Christianity and Judaism, specifically crucifixion. The user is sharing information about the cultural view on crucifixion in Jewish culture. They do not vilify Jews or use this information to demonize them. In fact, they are citing a source (Pastor Mensa Otabil) and referencing a book (\"The Power of the Cross\"). This tweet is neither expressing hatred nor targeting Jewish individuals or institutions. It simply discusses an aspect of religious history and does not fit within any of the categories of antisemitic expression listed in your provided definition. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1369: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes, and it merely questions why some Jews are still supporting a specific political party (D). While there might be underlying assumptions about political affiliations within the Jewish community, the tweet is not inherently antisemitic. It's also important to note that questioning the political preferences of one's own religious or ethnic group is different from demonizing, blaming or stereotyping Jews as a whole.\n",
      "Row 1370: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews nor does it target them with rhetorical or physical manifestations of antisemitism. Instead, the tweet is discussing historical events and proposes a hypothetical scenario on how the existence of Israel earlier might have saved more lives in WW2. The language used in this context does not demonize Jews or incite hatred towards them; thus, it falls outside the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 1371: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language or content. It is a quotation from the Bible, specifically from the book of Corinthians. The text emphasizes unity among Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) in the context of religious belief and spiritual connection. Although it refers to \"Jews,\" it does not express hatred, bigotry, or harmful sentiments towards them. Thus, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet cannot be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1372: [0] 0. The tweet does not use any hateful or derogatory language towards Jews or Jewish people. It is a conversation between users discussing their viewpoints on certain aspects of Judaism and Zionism.

The conversation does not exhibit any antisemitic rhetoric based on the definition you've provided.\n",
      "Row 1373: [0] 0. Although the tweet contains a sarcastic reference to antisemitism in Germany in the 1930s, it does not directly attack or demonize Jews. Instead, it highlights the absurdity of someone claiming they don't hate Jews but still supports actions with historical connections to antisemitism (e.g., supporting a leader like Hitler). The tweet is critical of such hypocrisy rather than promoting antisemitic views itself.\n",
      "Row 1374: [0] 0. This tweet does not demonstrate any hatred toward Jews or make antisemitic claims. It simply states that Christians, Muslims, and Jews are included in a particular context (presumably religious freedom in the United States), and mentions that the Constitution still applies during a pandemic. While it may briefly mention different religions, it is not demeaning, demonizing, or stereotypical about any of them, including Jews. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1375: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or language as defined in your guidelines. The author simply discusses how Ben Shapiro, a well-known political commentator, might be offending fellow Jews who do not align with his views.

      "Row 1376: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The author acknowledges that neo-Nazis still target Jews and expresses fear about being forgotten as one of their main targets when groups of them come together. While the term \"nazi\" refers to a group that targeted Jews, this usage is not intended to demean or demonize Jews or Jewish people in general. It is rather a critique of the belief that neo-Nazis have moved away from targeting Jews, and thus can be seen as a callout against anti-semitism, rather than as an expression of it.\n",
      "Row 1377: [0] 0. This tweet does not demonstrate antisemitic attitudes or beliefs towards Jews. It simply presents a hypothetical scenario about someone who supports Hitler for reasons other than antisemitism, such as the economy or political ideology. While it may allude to a historical context involving Jews, it is critical to note that this tweet does not directly express any hatred towards Jews or make generalized claims about them. It instead highlights the separation between political beliefs and personal opinions about specific groups of people.

      "Row 1378: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly use any hateful or stereotypical language against Jews, but rather criticizes the IDF's actions in the West Bank and challenges people to take a stand for the protection of civilians.

Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1379: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or language according to the definition provided. It is a call for remembrance and solidarity on Holocaust Memorial Day, acknowledging the suffering of multiple victim groups targeted by the Nazis during the Holocaust. While Jews are listed among these targeted groups, the focus lies in remembering all victims collectively and emphasizing that \"Never again\" applies to all marginalized groups. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic but rather a call for unity and remembrance.\n",
      "Row 1380: [0] 1. The tweet you provided appears to be antisemitic according to the definition given. Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "The text \"Tell that to the Jews during the Holocaust.\" seems to reference or compare something unfavorable to the treatment of Jews during the Holocaust, an event rooted in profound and undeniable antisemitism. This is a clear attempt at demonizing Jews and invoking historical trauma against them, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweet seems to justify or defend something by likening it to the Holocaust, using it as an example for how such actions were acceptable in that past time, and implying that they are acceptable now too. This kind of use of the Holocaust can be seen as dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective, which is mentioned as antisemitic behavior in your definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, according to my interpretation of your definition, this tweet would be classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 1381: [1] 0. This tweet does not explicitly target Jews or contain any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about them. It mentions \"jews\" in the context of \"hiding in their closets\", which might be a reference to a stereotype but it is also unclear and ambiguous. However, as the primary focus of this tweet is on criticizing the whole government as being dominated by Catholics rather than targeting Jews specifically or promoting any form of hatred towards them, it does not meet the criteria for an antisemitic tweet according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1382: [0] 0. This tweet expresses criticism towards Jews being used as a political tool against the left, rather than demonizing or attacking Jewish individuals or organizations themselves. Although it mentions \"Jewish Communal Organisations,\" it is not blaming these organisations for any wrongdoing or harm but rather criticizes their perceived opportunism by participating in this kind of discourse. Hence, this tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitic according to the provided guidelines.\n",
      "Row 1383: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic content or language. It cites a quote from the Bible which is unrelated to antisemitic beliefs or tropes, and it does not target Jewish people with hatred or stereotypes. The tweet also refers to \"Charlie's legacy,\" presumably referring to Charles C. Djou (CDB/BW), a politician who has no known connections to antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1384: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target the Jewish community directly. It criticizes another user for accusing someone else of being anti-Semitic without considering that there are many anti-Zionist Jews who might have different opinions. Although it briefly mentions \"Jewish consensus\", this statement is made in the context of a debate about the political stance towards Israel, and not as an accusation against all Jewish people. Therefore, according to the definition of antisemitism provided, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1385: [0] 1. The tweet contains an antisemitic stereotype, specifically accusing Jews as a collective of inventing everything. This is an example of dehumanizing or demonizing Jews by using a broad and unfair generalization. According to the definition of antisemitism, this kind of statement falls under item 4: \"Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.\" So, my answer is 1 (antisemitic), and I provide a brief explanation why based on the definition you've shared.\n",
      "Row 1386: [0] 0. The tweet expresses disappointment in Jews who support Trump and refers to the political situation as a \"putrid sack of lies, greed, and division.\" While it is critical towards those Jews who hold opposing views, it does not demonize or dehumanize Jewish individuals nor does it employ antisemitic tropes. The tweet targets the politics being supported rather than the people themselves. Additionally, Tikkun Olam is a Jewish concept of repairing the world and is referenced here as an argument against supporting Trump, which again, doesn't fall into the category of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1387: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or rhetoric as described in the definition. It is a neutral quote from the biblical story found in the Book of Esther, which describes an event where Jews defended themselves against their enemies during the Persian Empire's reign under King Xerxes I. While it may be perceived by some as celebrating violence, its purpose seems to be sharing content from religious texts rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or promoting antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 1388: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism as it is not targeting Jews or Jewish institutions with hatred, stereotypes, or demonization. Instead, it criticizes certain people who may express such ideas and calls them \"assholes.\" Although it briefly references a historical event involving Jews (concentration camps), it does not use this reference to harm, attack, or dehumanize Jews or Jewish institutions.\n",
      "Row 1389: [0] 1. The tweet clearly targets and attacks an individual, Louis Farrakhan, with an antisemitic trope (accusing Jews of attempting to harm him). This usage of the term \"Jews\" is a stereotypical allegation often made against Jewish people. It is also important to note that Louis Farrakhan has himself made numerous anti-Semitic statements, but this doesn't justify or make acceptable any form of antisemitism. Therefore, based on the provided definition of antisemitism and considering this specific tweet, it can be classified as 1 (antisemitic). The attack on Louis Farrakhan is done through an antisemitic trope that dehumanizes Jewish people in a general sense. It's important to remember that even when targeting individuals who may themselves have expressed anti-Semitic sentiments, it doesn't make the use of such tropes and language acceptable.\n",
      "Row 1390: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly attack, demonize, or stereotype Jews or Israel. Rather, it criticizes a belief (that the virus was orchestrated for Jewish financial benefit), which can be seen as an antisemitic conspiracy theory, but the tweet itself doesn't propagate these tropes towards Jews or Israel explicitly. Therefore, while the underlying message might be rooted in an antisemitic conspiracy theory, the tweet is more focused on debunking that idea than promoting hatred against Jews.\n",
      "Row 1391: [0] 0. This tweet references \"Jews for Jesus\" but does not display any of the characteristics outlined as antisemitic in the definition provided. While some may interpret \"Jews for Jesus\" itself as controversial or contentious, merely referencing a religious group is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet does not contain language that expresses hatred toward Jews, nor do its contents demonize, stereotype, or target Jewish individuals or institutions.\n",

      "- The use of a slur in referring to Jews.\n",
      "- Accusing Jews of controlling everything.\n",
      "- Suggesting that there is a special word to dismiss criticism of them, which can be interpreted as accusing Jews of exaggerating or deflecting criticism (point 7).\n",

      "Based on these points and the overall negative and hateful tone towards Jewish individuals, I would classify this tweet as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1393: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote hatred towards Jews but rather criticizes the idea presented in \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" which is an antisemitic text itself.

The criticism of the false narrative does not inherently exhibit hatred or target any specific person or community.\n",
      "Row 1394: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes that target Jews individually or collectively. While the reference to a story in Surah Al-Baqarah from the Quran involves the Jews, it does not demonize, dehumanize, blame, or show hatred toward them. It is rather referencing a religious story and doesn't fulfill any of the definitions mentioned for antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1395: [0] 0. This tweet does not explicitly target or demonize Jews or Jewish people, but rather points out that the GOP is known for their hateful policies towards various groups, including Blacks, Latinos, Gays, and Women. While mentioning \"Jews\" in this context, it does not specifically attribute any hatred, blame, or conspiracy to them individually. The tweet's focus on criticizing the GOP's hateful policies is more focused on condemning those actions, rather than promoting antisemitic ideas. Thus, while mentioning Jews in a negative context, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1396: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes. While it uses \"Leave Jews in peace,\" the tone and context do not suggest a negative or hostile sentiment towards Jewish people. Instead, it seems to be advocating for respecting Jewish individuals' rights and leaving them alone, which is not inherently antisemitic. The use of \"Canadian Patriot\" also does not carry any clear association with historical or contemporary antisemitism. Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet should be classified as 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 1397: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly use antisemitic tropes or language, although it refers to the Holocaust, but it is doing so within the context of critiquing a comparison made by another user, which they find inaccurate and offensive. The criticized comparison between America's racial discourse and Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews is not in itself an antisemitic statement, rather, it highlights the severity of racism and historical atrocities committed by the Nazis. Therefore, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1398: [0] 0. This tweet does not display antisemitic behavior or language, despite mentioning \"Jews.\" It criticizes the portrayal of Democrats and Jews in relation to a political party, suggesting that Jews may not be as strongly associated with the particular group mentioned compared to gentiles. While it may seem like it could potentially be seen as stereotyping, the tweet's context is not to demonize or harm Jewish people but rather to question the representation of Democrats and Jews in a specific situation. As such, it doesn't meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1399: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the criteria of antisemitism according to the provided definition. It expresses disagreement and a stance against accusing Jews of spreading antisemitic tropes, which is not inherently an antisemitic statement. While it may be interpreted as contentious or argumentative, it is critical towards accusations of Jews perpetuating white supremacist rhetoric, rather than promoting such ideas itself.\n",
      "Row 1400: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic. It seems to be questioning the possibility of an \"Israelex\" event occurring again (referring to a possible Israeli election or debate-like event) and suggests that lessons from previous events should be learned carefully by both Israelis and Jews. The tweet does not demonstrate hatred towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or their property, Jewish community institutions, or religious facilities. It also doesn't contain any of the examples listed as contemporary manifestations of antisemitism in the provided definition, such as accusing Jews collectively for wrongdoings committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew or calling for harm to be inflicted upon Jews. As a result, this tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitic content.\n",

The tweet is not antisemitic as it does not contain any hateful or dehumanizing language towards Jews or Israel, nor does it blame them for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or non-Jew.

      "Row 1402: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not target or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions. It expresses gratitude towards those who support its message and acknowledges that there are true Jews who know the truth. Although the term \"true Jews\" could be interpreted as implying a difference between 'real' Jews and others, in this context, it is being used to emphasize solidarity with individuals who understand the truth, rather than disparaging others.

      "Row 1403: [0] 1. This tweet contains clear and undisguised antisemitic language, specifically referring to the historical act of sending Jews to concentration camps and claiming it as an internal matter. By stating that external forces should only be spectators, it justifies the exclusion of non-Jews from intervening against this atrocity, which is a common antisemitic theme of blaming outsiders for Jewish problems while simultaneously denying the legitimacy and right to existence of those who are affected. This tweet meets all three criteria of antisemitism: it targets Jews both as individuals (by referring to them collectively) and as a community/nation (by invoking the concept of sovereignty); it employs hateful language towards Jews; and, it justifies the mistreatment of Jews. Therefore, this tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition, and therefore it's answer is 1.\n",
      "Row 1404: [0] 0. The provided tweet does not contain any antisemitic elements or language. It is asking a question about historical Islamic events involving a Companion and a well that was bought from Jews in Madinah for the benefit of Muslims.

      "Row 1406: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or incite harm against Jewish individuals or institutions. It critiques the power of police unions and raises concerns about which groups might be targeted next, but it is not specifically targeting or demonizing Jews.

      "Row 1407: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it calls out antisemitic rhetoric that portrays \"Israel (Jews) as the root of all problems\" and encourages individuals who cannot see this rhetoric as being antisemitic to educate themselves on anti-Semitism. The tweet is critical of such a viewpoint and does not express hatred or demonization towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 1408: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic because it clarifies that Zionism is not the same as Judaism, distinguishing between a religion and a political ideology. It also points out that many Jews are not Zionists, most Zionists are not Jewish, and many Zionists hate Jews. The tweet then concludes by stating that opposition to Israel and Zionism is not anti-Semitism. By providing this information, it counters some antisemitic tropes and stereotypes, thus not being antisemitic itself.\n",
      "Row 1409: [0] 0. This tweet discusses historical events and does not target or demonize Jewish people. It compares the concepts of Hitler's Master Race manifesto in Mein Kampf and Anglo-Saxon supremacy, but it does not imply any negative stereotypes or blame Jews or Israel for these concepts. The tweet is focused on discussing historical events and comparisons rather than antisemitic behavior.\n",
      "Row 1410: [0] 0. This tweet remembers those who were persecuted and murdered during the Holocaust, which includes Jews as well as other marginalized groups. It is not antisemitic but rather serves to remember and honor the victims of the Holocaust by naming the various groups that were targeted.\n",
      "Row 1411: [0] 0. While this tweet expresses disappointment and concern, it does not contain any overt antisemitic language or tropes. It is critical of Jews who align themselves with fascists but does not target all Jewish individuals or demonize them as a collective.

      "Row 1412: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes a comparison between BDS and violent fascists, which implies that the user is not in agreement with such a comparison. It does not use antisemitic language or support any of the points outlined as antisemitic behavior. The user expresses concern about actual Nazis and their actions but does not target Jewish individuals or the state of Israel with hatred or false accusations. The user's critique of Andrew Yang is related to his use of \"dangerous dual loyalty tropes\" in regard to opposing BDS, which also falls outside the criteria for antisemitic behavior according to this definition.\n",
      "Row 1413: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user is comparing different cases of genocide throughout history, including that of Jews in the 20th century. While mentioning the Holocaust, it does not accuse or demonize Jews or Israel for anything; it rather contrasts the situation in China with historical and current human rights issues faced by other ethnic groups. The tweet is critical toward claims of \"genocide\" in Xinjiang but it does not use any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations against Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 1414: [0] 0. This tweet acknowledges that not all individuals or countries during the time of the Holocaust were supportive of the Nazi goals targeting Jews, which implies that it is not making a blanket statement about collective guilt.

It is merely mentioning Passover, which is a Jewish holiday, and refers to \"Matzah\" (unleavened bread eaten during Passover) in the context of an average consumption amount. There is no hatred, discrimination, or harm towards Jews in this tweet, therefore it does not fit within the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 1416: [0] 0. This tweet addresses the existence of racialised antisemitism and provides examples of it in modern society, which is not necessarily antisemitic by itself.

      "Row 1420: [0] 0. This tweet is critical of Ted Cruz's actions, pointing out that the author (Sara Spector) and other liberal Jews did not engage in the violent behavior he implies they might have.

The tweet does not express hatred towards Jews nor accuse all Jews collectively for any issue, and although it includes a stereotype about Jews being overly concerned with Israel, the tone appears to question the squad rather than directly blame or demonize Jews.

The critical difference here is that this tweet lacks intent to malign or dehumanize the Jewish people. It could be perceived as a misunderstanding rather than an act of malice.\n",
      "Row 1654: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the assumption that merely discussing their own history would automatically mean they support \"ethnic cleansing of Jews,\" suggesting that such assumptions are both unfair and potentially racist in nature.

      "Row 1665: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or use rhetoric that demonizes, dehumanizes, or stereotypes Jewish individuals or their community institutions and religious facilities. It is discussing the historical context of Jews returning to Israel and the role of Zionism in this process without resorting to antisemitic tropes.

      "Row 1695: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any explicit language that demonizes or targets Jews or Jewish individuals. Instead, it merely discusses a situation where Orthodox Jews and Hindu nationalists attended a rally with photos of an Indian flag in front of the Capitol building.

      "Row 1700: [0]  0. The tweet does not explicitly target Jews with hatred, nor does it express any kind of antisemitic sentiment or ideology. It mentions \"deported Jews\" and \"persecuted gays and lesbians,\" but this is done in a context where the user is pointing out that some events or groups were left out of ConnollyBooks' post, rather than expressing hatred toward these groups themselves. This critique of omission does not fall under the definition of antisemitism provided by the IHRA working definition as it doesn't target Jews with hatred nor demonize or stereotype them.\n",
      "Row 1701: [0] 0. This tweet is not directly targeting Jewish individuals or institutions with hatred or harm. The author discusses a political issue between Israel and Palestine but does not demonize or stereotype Jews as a whole.

      "Row 1712: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes the political decisions made by Bush 41 and suggests that a different outcome would have occurred if he hadn't \"pissed off the Jews.\" While it might not be phrased delicately, this tweet is not using antisemitic tropes to blame or harm Jews. It does not call for or justify violence toward Jews or express hatred towards them.

      "Row 1714: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews, nor demonize or target them with stereotypical allegations. The author highlights that some Israel advocacy groups are critical of Jewish people who support Israel and have a \"serious hateful obsession\" about it, but this is not the same as promoting antisemitic ideas or actions. This tweet is merely pointing out a perceived issue within these Israel advocacy groups and does not incite hatred toward Jews as a whole.\n",
      "Row 1715: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or spread antisemitic tropes. The user is stating that they are opposed to Hamas, a militant organization in Palestine, and not targeting individuals or the Jewish people as a whole. While there may be some criticism of an individual who has expressed hate towards Jews or Israel (indicated by \"@insyirahsahardi @itsmeriya123\"), this alone does not make this tweet antisemitic. It is more important to focus on the content of the user's own statements, which are not antisemitic in nature.\n",
      "Row 1716: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them specifically, though it does mention Jews alongside \"murdered dissenters\" which is a problematic phrasing. However, the primary focus of this tweet is on discussing Hitler's perceived positive impact on Germany, rather than inciting hatred or demonizing Jewish people. While the inclusion of Jewish victims along with others could be seen as dismissive and somewhat insensitive to their unique historical plight, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the given definition without a clear intent to incite hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 1717: [1] 0. This tweet calls out an unjust political situation in Israel without demonizing or dehumanizing Jews as a whole. While the term \"Jewish ethno-national apartheid state\" can be considered inflammatory, it's crucial to consider the context and overall message of this particular tweet. The author argues that liberating Palestinians will also benefit Jews, implying unity and shared struggle for justice. This statement does not align with the definition of antisemitism according to the given guidelines.\n",
      "Row 1718: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions with hatred or prejudice. The author is critical of those who care more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than about other human rights issues around the world, but this criticism is not intrinsically antisemitic. While it suggests that the focus on this issue might be driven by antisemitic motives, it does not itself express hate or prejudice towards Jewish people or institutions. Thus, according to the definition provided, it falls under \"0\" as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1719: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or language. It actually refutes the idea that Palestinians are Jews by clarifying that Jews have faced persecution for centuries and that Israel has served as a sanctuary for Jewish lives.

It does not contain any hatred or dehumanization of Jews.\n",
      "Row 1720: [0] 0. While this tweet does mention \"the Jewish engagement party\" and \"Jews,\" it is not using them as a means to express hatred or demonize Jews. Instead, it is implying that \"Dictator Dan\" used the event as an excuse to extend lockdown measures, and criticizing those who do not address this perceived manipulation. Although the tweet does touch on Jews in its content, it is not utilizing antisemitic language or tropes to attack Jewish individuals or institutions, but rather critiquing a political figure's actions that involve an association with Jews.\n",
      "Row 1721: [0] Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, it seems that the given tweet does not fall under its parameters. It is suggesting that there might be a negative outcome for Jews if something continues, but it's not accusing or blaming Jewish people for anything wrong, nor is it using stereotypes or tropes about Jews or Israel.

The author is expressing an opinion on the influence of American Jews in relation to US policy towards Israel and does not target Jewish individuals or communities with hatred, nor is it demonizing or stereotypical about Jews or Israel.

The tweet itself does not express hatred or demonize Jews as a group; rather, it critiques someone (presumably @semprescettica and @ACafTrampe) for sharing documents that accuse Jews of committing terrible acts.

      "Row 1726: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes Owen Jones for speaking over the heads of minority communities, including Jewish people, but does not express hatred or demonization towards Jews. Instead, it is questioning why a person who is not elected as a leader should have influence on discussions related to race and minorities, suggesting that his position may be a \"grift\".

This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions with negative rhetoric, nor does it blame Jews for \"why things go wrong.\" It emphasizes the importance of education and understanding how historical events such as the Holocaust occurred.

Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1765: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly target or demonize Jews; rather, it discusses the historical role of Jews as scapegoats and suggests that their non-proselytizing nature and small population make them an easy target for blame.

      "Row 1767: [0] 0. This tweet highlights a perceived issue with defending Jewish rights due to the mention of \"anti-Zionism\" not equating to anti-Semitism. Although it discusses the debate between Zionism and anti-Zionism, it does not demonize or attack Jews or Judaism. It criticizes the need to add conditions when defending Jewish rights, but it doesn't express hatred towards Jews. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1768: [0] 0. While this tweet acknowledges past antisemitism and expresses disbelief about its tolerance, it does not contain any direct hateful language or targeted attacks against Jewish individuals or institutions.

The options in the quiz (A, B, C, D) critique Israeli government policy but do not directly attack Jewish people or Judaism as a religion. Instead, they question the actions of the state of Israel. Criticizing the actions of a nation-state is different from criticizing its citizens based on their ethnicity or religious beliefs. Thus, it falls under category 0: \"not antisemitic.\"\n",
      "Row 1771: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the British Jews for purchasing a copy of The Guardian, an English-language newspaper, and claims that due to The Guardian's supposed antisemitic tendencies, it will eventually be forgotten.

Although it cites an instance of historical suffering endured by the Jewish community during the Holocaust, it is not in itself using this fact to promote hatred or bigotry towards Jews today. Therefore, according to your definition and considering the context provided in the tweet, it should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",

This tweet is criticizing the concept of Jewish people having a right to expel native people from their homeland, but it does not demonstrate hatred toward Jews or target individual Jews or Jewish institutions.

It criticizes Tucker Carlson's rhetoric and compares it to the harmful rhetoric used against Jews in 1930's Germany for historical context. The tweet is highlighting a potential connection between Carlson's comments and the antisemitic tactics of the past, rather than expressing hatred or demonizing towards Jews or Jewish people.\n",

While this tweet contains an argument about the Arab-Israeli conflict and uses humor to present it, it does not inherently contain antisemitic language or express hatred towards Jews.

It is not directly demonizing or blaming all Jews for the actions of Israel, nor does it use any classic antisemitic tropes (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel).

      "Row 1789: [1] The answer for this particular tweet would be 1, as it appears to express hatred towards Jewish people by asserting that they \"run\" countries such as Germany and the U.S., a stereotype commonly associated with antisemitism. The statement is an overgeneralization that ascribes control and influence to all Jews in two nations, which is not representative of the diverse population within each nation but rather propagates harmful myths about Jewish control over societies. This aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it targets Jews or non-Jewish individuals or their property, towards Jewish community institutions and religious facilities, and includes the targeting of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.\n",

The criticism of her alleged stance does not demonize or dehumanize Jewish people, but rather challenges the perceived logic behind her comments. It is crucial to differentiate between criticism of political actions and institutions, such as AOC's statements, and antisemitic rhetoric that targets individuals or communities based on their ethnicity or religion.

This type of discourse, particularly when it comes to blaming Jewish people for the problems faced by others or asserting a perceived superiority of one's own group over Jews, can be classified as antisemitic. The use of historical atrocities and victimization against Germans and Aryan race to further blame Jews also echoes common antisemitic tropes and fallacies.

This use of language demonstrates hatred towards Jewish people and falls under the category of dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews collectively, according to the definition you have provided.\n",
      "Row 2086: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the given definition for the following reasons:\n",
      "1. The term \"kikes\" is a derogatory slur specifically targeting Jews.\n",
      "2. The context implies that Jews have an undue influence on the sale of weapons, which is a common antisemitic conspiracy theory.\n",
      "3. The use of the word \"undoubtedly\" emphasizes the belief in the conspiracy theory and reinforces its negative intent towards Jews.\n",
      "4. The inclusion of the hashtag \"#altfacts\" could be interpreted as a mockery of facts that challenge or counter the antisemitic narrative promoted by the tweet.\n",
      "Row 2087: [0] 1 (Yes, the tweet is antisemitic according to this definition). The use of the word \"Kikes\" is an antisemitic slur. It targets Jewish individuals with hatred and stereotyping, which aligns with the definition provided. Although the definition acknowledges that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic, this tweet does not seem to engage in a critical conversation about Israeli policy or actions. Instead, it directly targets Jewish individuals with hateful language, making it an instance of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2088: [0] 0. This tweet points out that certain ethnic slurs are not used in friendly contexts among the groups they refer to. While it does mention a historically derogatory term for Jews (\"kikes\"), it is not used in an antagonistic manner in this tweet, but rather as a comparison to show how other ethnic terms are not commonly used among their respective communities. It is important to consider that while the term \"kike\" is offensive and has been historically used as a slur against Jews, its use in this tweet does not seem to be directed towards harming or demonizing Jewish people but rather highlight a difference in societal norms and language usage among different groups.\n",
      "Row 2089: [0] 1. The tweet you provided does contain language that is antisemitic in nature. Al Sharpton has used derogatory terms for Jews (\"Diamond Merchants\", \"Kikes\") and incited violence against them during the Crown Heights Riots. However, this tweet is not directly making accusations or blaming all Jews for actions of one individual (Al Sharpton) in the past, nor does it target Israel or Jewish community institutions/religious facilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, since the language used in the tweet refers to the past antisemitic behavior of an individual and not a recent example of systemic antisemitism directed towards Jewish people as individuals, communities or Israel, I'd interpret this more as historical context rather than ongoing or newly propagated hate speech. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, it is crucial to note that although the language used may be offensive and derogatory towards Jews, it does not directly incite violence against them nor demonize or stereotype all Jews collectively for the actions of one individual. It's important to remember that individuals can exhibit prejudice, but that doesn't mean they represent their entire community or faith. \n",
      "\n",
      "So while this tweet certainly reflects negatively on Al Sharpton's past behavior, and it is necessary to acknowledge and address such language, it doesn't fit entirely within the definition of contemporary antisemitism as described by your provided text. It would be better categorized under \"9. Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation\" or \"10. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel\". Hence, considering this specific tweet doesn't directly blame all Jews for the actions of one individual nor target the Jewish community in general or the state of Israel specifically, it would be more accurately categorized as 0 (Not Antisemitic). However, it is important to emphasize that these are complex issues and each case should be assessed on its own merit.\n",
      "Row 2090: [0] 1. The tweet contains a derogatory term for Jews (\"kikes\"), which is an antisemitic slur, and the content of the message does not appear to have any legitimate purpose or context that would justify its use. Additionally, the term \"Mint Slices\" seems to be used sarcastically in reference to a stereotype about Jews liking mint-flavored items, which can also be considered antisemitic. Considering these factors and taking into account the definition of antisemitism provided earlier, I conclude that this tweet is indeed antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2091: [1] 0. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The term \"kikes\" is used in a derogatory and offensive manner, but it appears in an unpopular opinion context, indicating that the user might be making fun of such views rather than expressing them genuinely. Moreover, the tweet contains many emojis and symbols which do not fit the conventional context of antisemitic hatred or dehumanization.\n",
      "2. Although the content includes a term associated with hate speech, the overall tone appears more satirical and less sincere. This can be seen through the use of \"rawr xd\", \"üöë ‚≠ê ‚Üî üöô ‚óÄ üÜí üë° üåû üåª üíû üî∂ üêí\" which further indicates that this tweet is not intended to be taken seriously or express genuine hatred towards Jewish individuals.\n",

      "Therefore, despite using a term associated with antisemitism, the content and tone of the tweet do not qualify as hateful, dehumanizing, or inciting violence against Jews or their community.\n",
      "Row 2092: [0] 1. According to this definition, the tweet \" @kikes12 @EACCKenya Kikes you'll get Justice..Never relent!\" is indeed antisemitic. It uses a slur (\"Kikes\") directed towards Jews and makes accusations against them without any substantiation or context. This clearly falls under the category of making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as per your definition. The use of the term \"kikes\" alone indicates that it is a hateful term often used in antisemitic discourse, thus making this tweet an example of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2093: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly promote hate, stereotypes, or target Jews specifically. It is a reference to a movie and its song (Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo's \"Samajavaragamana\"), where the user playfully mentions 600k likes for the hashtag \"#samajavaragamanaa.\" The term \"kikes\" is used colloquially and not in a hateful manner towards Jews. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2094: [0] 0. The provided tweet does not contain any clear antisemitic language or content, and its phrasing is not easily understood in the context of contemporary antisemitism. It appears to be a nonsensical or unclear statement that doesn't target Jews or Israel with hatred or harmful rhetoric. While some users may misinterpret it as an attempt at antisemitism due to the word \"kikes,\" the lack of context and coherence make it difficult to classify as such.\n",
      "Row 2095: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic as it uses the term \"kikes,\" which is a derogatory and antisemitic slur targeting Jews. The tweeter employs an antagonistic tone that includes multiple other hateful terms, indicating a general disregard for marginalized groups. Furthermore, the message implies that these groups are collectively responsible for societal issues, echoing tropes of collective responsibility often associated with antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2096: [1] 1. The tweet you provided contains derogatory language (\"kikes\") and is promoting the use of #alternativefacts, a term that was previously used to denigrate Jews.

      "Row 2097: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition. The use of \"Joooos\" and \"those kikes\" are dehumanizing, demonizing, and stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective, which falls under point 4 of your definition of antisemitism. It does not serve to call out antisemitic behavior but rather perpetuates it by using such language.\n",
      "Row 2098: [0] 0. The given text, \"depress kikes,\" is a clear example of antisemitic language as it directly targets Jews using a derogatory term (\"kikes\") and aims to harm them emotionally through the mention of depression. According to my understanding of your definition and the examples you provided, such a tweet would be categorized as antisemitic. It does not fit the category of calling out antisemitism or criticizing antisemitic tropes while maintaining neutrality on the subject itself. The text is directly targeted at Jewish people, uses hate speech against them, and does not serve any constructive purpose in a public discourse.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tweet uses the term \"kikes,\" which is a pejorative slur referring to Jews. Additionally, the statement that the \"crisis currently plaguing kikes\" implies blaming Jews for the Syrian crisis, which falls under the category of accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for wrongdoing committed by an individual Jew or Non-Jew (antisemitic point #5). Therefore, based on these points and according to the definition provided, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2100: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition. It contains several elements that qualify it as such:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The use of \"kikes,\" a slur directed towards Jews, implies hatred and intends to demean or insult Jewish individuals.\n",
      "- By mentioning that this viewpoint won't be heard on mainstream media, it reinforces the notion that the speaker believes there is a conspiracy between the Jews (referenced by \"kikes\") and the mainstream media. This idea of Jews conspiring to control media falls under the stereotype category listed in the definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet not only expresses hatred towards Jews but also perpetuates the antisemitic belief that Jews collectively control the media, which is a common conspiracy theory related to antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2101: [0] 1. This tweet contains a term \"kikes,\" which is an antisemitic slur directed towards Jewish people. The combination of this word and the context, referring to Justin Turner resting his chin on another individual's shoulder, suggests a mockery or derogatory reference towards Jews. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet can be considered as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2102: [1] 1. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, the tweet you shared contains antisemitic language and sentiment, specifically in referring to Jews as \"kikes.\" The use of the term \"kike\" is a slur against Jewish people and thus qualifies as a manifestation of hatred toward Jews. Therefore, based on the definition given, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2103: [0] 1. The term \"Kikes\" used in this tweet falls under category 4 of antisemitism, which states that it is antisemitic to make dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. This term is an ethnic slur specifically targeting Jewish people and contributes to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes and stigmatization. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2104: [1] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic content as it uses the derogatory term \"kikes\" which targets Jews. In addition, the statement seems to express satisfaction with Jews being overthrown, potentially suggesting violence or persecution against Jews.

      "Row 2105: [1] 0. This tweet does not explicitly demonstrate antisemitic behavior according to the provided definition, although it does contain an antisemitic slur (\"kikes\"). However, the context of the tweet is a discussion about a socialist revolution and its basis, which is unrelated to any form of hatred or malice towards Jewish individuals. The use of the term \"kikes\" alone does not make this tweet antisemitic as it is neither expressing hatred nor targeting individuals or their property, community institutions, religious facilities, or the state of Israel.

      "Row 2107: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not exhibit hatred or violence towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals, institutions, or their property. The term \"kikes\" is undeniably derogatory and antisemitic; however, the context of the tweet does not use this word to express hatred or harm towards Jews but rather to criticize the media for using a perceived double standard in reporting about Syria. Thus, while it contains an element of antisemitism (use of \"kikes\"), it is not classified as an antisemitic statement due to its non-hateful and non-violent intent when looking at the whole context.\n",
      "Row 2108: [0] 0. This tweet is discussing the actions of a person who found someone complaining about leftists calling Jews kikes, then put them on blast to discredit them.

However, it doesn't call for any harm towards Jewish individuals or institutions and does not fall under any other point defined as antisemitism in the provided definition.

Additionally, it uses a racial slur (\"niggers\") targeting African Americans, which is not related to antisemitism but reflects general bigotry and prejudice. The tweet displays hateful speech toward both Jewish people and another marginalized group, indicating a strong bias based on race or religion.\n",
      "Row 2115: [1] 1. The term \"kikes\" used in this tweet is a clear example of stereotypical and dehumanizing language directed towards Jewish individuals.

      "Row 2116: [1] 1. The usage of \"Zionazi\" in this context is problematic, as it combines two historically and currently persecuted groups (Jews and those opposed to the Nazi regime). This combination suggests that Jews are being equated with Nazis or are somehow associated with historical atrocities committed by them. As such, it meets the definition of antisemitism mentioned, where it frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity and uses classic antisemitism (in this case, equating Jews/Zionists with Nazis) to characterize Israel.

      "Row 2118: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it accuses \"zionazis\" of committing atrocities and crimes against the \"defenceless people of Palestine.\" The term \"zionazi\" is a blatant combination of \"Zionist\" (a supporter of Zionism) and \"Nazi\" (member of the Nazi Party in Germany or someone who supports its ideology), which serves to dehumanize Jews and hold them responsible for the actions of a nation-state, Israel. Furthermore, it also targets Jews as a collective group by referring to them as \"zionazis,\" thus perpetuating antisemitic tropes and ideas.\n",
      "Row 2119: [1] 0. This tweet calls out another user, Rachel Riley, for being \"toxic\" and a \"zionazi.\" While the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic, the context here is not using the slur to attack or demonize Jews but to criticize another individual's behavior. It doesn't express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it highlights perceived problematic actions of an individual who has used the term before.

It uses the term \"Zionazi\" as an attack and demonstrates a hostile attitude towards Jews, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism as hateful expression or action directed at Jewish individuals or their community. The use of the word \"little\" further implies belittlement and ridicule. This tweet is not criticizing any particular instance of antisemitic behavior; it is itself an example of such behavior. It calls out no other issues, so it does not fall under the category of a non-antisemitic tweet calling out antisemitism as per your provided examples.\n",

However, in this context, the author is using it as shorthand for a political ideology, rather than as an insult aimed at Jews generally. The tweet appears to be discussing the politics of Zionism and its origins without explicitly targeting Jewish individuals or their property, institutions, or religious facilities, nor does it charge Jews with conspiracy, dehumanize, demonize, or make stereotypical allegations against them collectively.

Instead, it appears that the user is mocking the other individual who used the phrase \"Zionazi\" against them, possibly suggesting a lack of understanding about the severity and offensiveness of their words. In this context, while the term itself is antisemitic, the tweet does not seem to be promoting or supporting antisemitic ideologies or beliefs, but rather is criticizing another user's use of an antisemitic slur.

The tweet's focus is on a political ideology rather than targeting Jews or Judaism itself. Although the term \"Zionazi\" is antisemitic due to its conflation of Zionism and Nazism, the author does not use it in this context to attack or demonize Jews but to critique U.S. foreign policy.

Therefore, this tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism provided in the task description.\n",
      "Row 2141: [1] 0. The tweet calls out alleged \"fake news\" by criticizing those who it refers to as \"Zionazis.\" While \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, the context here suggests that the user is using this phrase to critique individuals they perceive as spreading false information rather than demonizing or targeting Jewish people. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2142: [1] 0. This tweet seems to be critical of an alleged action involving \"zionazi Jews\" rather than being antisemitic itself. It uses the term \"zionazi,\" which is a pejorative and antisemitic combination of words, but in this context it is used to question why certain individuals (those with dual citizenship) are invited somewhere while implying that they have committed violent acts against Palestinians. The tweet does not inherently demonize or attack Jews as a group, nor does it express hatred towards them, and thus would be considered not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2143: [1] 0. According to the definition provided, this tweet does not appear to be antisemitic as it criticizes \"zionazist propaganda\" rather than targeting Jewish individuals or groups with hatred or violence. While \"zionazi\" is a derogatory term that combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" the use of this term here seems more aimed at expressing disdain for the propaganda rather than attacking Jews or Judaism. As such, it can be considered as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2144: [1] 0. This tweet does call out antisemitic tropes, such as comparing Israeli actions to Nazi actions and referring to Jewish people collectively as \"Zionazis.\" However, it is criticizing the alleged mistreatment of Palestinians and pointing out that this treatment is inhumane and antisemitic. Although it uses antisemitic language, it is critical of these ideas rather than promoting them. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic since it calls out the problematic nature of the mentioned rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 2145: [1] 0. The tweet compares someone's actions or behavior to that of \"Zionazis\", which is an antisemitic term, but in this context, the user does not use this term against Jews nor does it express hatred toward them. Instead, the author seems to call out the inconsistency they see between how mainstream media covers Nazis and their perceived lesser coverage of what they consider \"Zionazis\". This tweet is not antisemitic as it is not aimed at demonizing or harming Jews or Jewish individuals. The use of 'Zionazi' here seems to be used in a metaphorical way rather than to promote hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 2146: [1] 0. This tweet refers to Israelis as \"zionazi snipers\" and criticizes their use of force during protests, suggesting that they lack a moral compass. While the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic because it associates Jews or Israelis with Nazism (an inherently hateful term), in this specific context the criticism is directed toward the alleged actions of the \"zionazi snipers,\" rather than attacking Jewish people as a collective. The tweet may reflect an opinion on the actions of the Israeli government, but it does not appear to demonstrate hatred or prejudice towards Jewish people as a whole.\n",
      "Row 2147: [1] 1. The tweet contains antisemitic language, specifically the term \"zionazi.\" This term is a combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" both with negative connotations. Zionists are people who support the creation and existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish state or a haven for Jews. Nazi refers to the National Socialist German Workers' Party, a political group responsible for the Holocaust during World War II. Using such language to target individuals or groups associated with Israel or Judaism falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"Their blood lust is insatiable\" can be interpreted as demonizing Jews or Israel, which can further contribute to a negative perception towards them. This contributes to stereotypical allegations against Jews and the Jewish state.\n",

      "Considering these factors, I classify this tweet as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2148: [1] 1. The tweet refers to someone as \"clueless\" and then uses the term \"ZioNazi,\" which is a combination of the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" The latter term is widely recognized as a pejorative used to demonize Jews, while the former can refer to individuals who support Israel or Jewish nationalism. In this case, using these terms together appears to be an attempt to portray a person's views in a negative light by associating them with both Nazi ideology and Israel/Jewish nationalism, which are historically rooted in antisemitic beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic due to its use of the term \"ZioNazi\" with the intention to attack or demonize someone, thereby fitting within the category of \"dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.\" The presence of this slur suggests that the user has intentions rooted in antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 2149: [1] Based on the provided definition of antisemitism and considering that this tweet is targeting an individual (Mark Levin) by labeling him a \"ZioNazi\", it could be perceived as containing elements of antisemitism. However, in this specific context, it seems to be more focused on criticizing Mr. Levin's stance on Iran and accusing Israel of being a threat to world peace due to its desire for regional and global hegemony.\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweet does not directly express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions explicitly. While \"ZioNazi\" can be considered an antisemitic term, in this case, it seems that the author is using it more as a criticism of Mr. Levin's political views rather than expressing hatred towards Jews. The latter part of the tweet regarding Iran, Israel, and world peace does not directly target or demonize Jewish people either, but rather criticizes the politics of a nation-state (Israel).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is crucial to emphasize that even though this tweet may not be explicitly antisemitic in nature, the use of \"ZioNazi\" could evoke negative sentiments towards Jews.

      "\n",
      "Considering these aspects, my answer would be 0 as this tweet does not clearly meet the criteria of expressing antisemitism based on the provided definition. It mainly criticizes Mr. Levin's political stance and accuses Israel of certain actions without targeting Jewish individuals or institutions in a hateful manner.\n",
      "Row 2150: [1] 1. The provided tweet does contain elements that are antisemitic according to the definition. The author uses derogatory language such as \"zionazi\", \"pig\", and \"liars\" while targeting the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). This is a form of dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or Israel, which are included in the definition of antisemitism. Furthermore, the author ends the tweet with hashtags for \"#FreeGaza\" and \"#BDS\", both of which can be associated with anti-Israel activism that often contains elements of antisemitism. Therefore, my answer is 1 (antisemitic) due to the language used and the intent behind it.\n",
      "Row 2151: [1] 0. The given tweet does not contain any language or sentiment that fits within the definition of antisemitism provided. It merely informs about the temporary unavailability of an account due to a violation of Twitter's Media Policy, which is not specific to the context of Jews or anti-Semitic sentiments. As such, it does not fit any of the criteria outlined in your provided definition. Thus, it cannot be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2152: [1] 1. The tweet uses the term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" with a slur against Jewish people (\"Nazi\"). This combination is used to demonize both Jews and Israeli supporters as terrorists, which falls under the definition of antisemitism in this context. Therefore, according to this definition, the tweet can be considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2153: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it uses the term \"ZioNazis\" to refer to Jews or those who support Israel, conflating two historically oppressive groups (Nazis and Zionists) in a way that demonizes and dehumanizes Jewish people. The statement also falsely accuses them of seeking power over the world, which is a common antisemitic trope.\n",
      "Row 2154: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic because it does not express hatred towards Jews or incite harm against them, nor does it solely target Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities. While the term \"ZioNazi\" may be antisemitic, here it appears to be used as a descriptor for a group of people, and does not inherently attack or demonize Jews collectively. It is possible that the author is highlighting a perceived connection between different individuals or groups they find problematic rather than directly attacking Jewish people themselves. Therefore, the tweet should not be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2155: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes Eddie Donovan for spreading information that is perceived as defaming Muslims, and it claims that this action is being forced by \"Zionazis.\" However, the term \"zionazi\" itself is an antisemitic slur combining \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" but it's not used to attack or demonize Jewish people in this specific case. Instead, it's directed towards a non-Jewish entity (\"the Zionazis\") that are presumed to manipulate Eddie Donovan. Thus, while the tweet contains an antisemitic term, its intent is more focused on critiquing alleged dishonesty of the referred party rather than promoting or spreading hatred toward Jewish people. Hence, it should be classified as not-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2156: [1] 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic behavior of other users, using the term \"zionazi\" to mock those who are exposing and accusing others of lies and deception.

It does not fit the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2157: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jews but rather criticizes \"Zionazis\" (an antisemitic term) in the context of political actions taken by some Israelis towards Palestinians. Although it uses an antisemitic term, it does not use it to target Jewish people as a collective or demonize them. Instead, it is used as a criticism towards the politics and actions of certain individuals related to Israel. This critique, in this specific context, is targeted at political choices made by a group, rather than against Jews as a whole. As such, while the wording might be considered antisemitic due to its origins, the intent here appears to be one of critiquing political actions, not demonizing Jewish people. Therefore, the tweet should be classified as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2158: [1] 0. The tweet criticizes the Zionist regime in Israel for its alleged war crimes and calls out the worst crimes against humanity. While it uses the term \"ZioNazi,\" which can be perceived as antisemitic due to its reference to Nazism, the context of this tweet is critical towards the actions attributed to the Israeli government, rather than demonizing or targeting Jews or Jewish individuals. The use of such terms should not be conflated with being inherently antisemitic when critiquing political policies or actions related to Israel, as long as it does not incite hatred or violence against Jewish individuals.\n",

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it does not express hatred toward Jews nor target Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, their property, institutions, religious facilities, or Israel in a demonizing or stereotypical manner.

Instead, the tweet is mocking an idea rather than endorsing it; thus, it is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2160: [1] 0. According to the definition provided, the use of the term \"ZioNazi\" in this tweet is being used by the author not to attack or demonize Jews, but rather to call out others for using antisemitic language.

It is similar to how the third example provided calls out other users for using derogatory terms against the Jewish community.\n",

It uses a term that combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" which is a known antisemitic slur, and also alleges violence against school children.

      "Row 2162: [1] 0. The tweet is criticizing the use of the term \"Zionazi\" directed towards Jewish individuals, indicating that it's an antisemitic slur. It does not demonize or attack Jews; rather, it condemns the act of using such a term, which is consistent with the definition you provided. This tweet is therefore not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2163: [1] 0. While \"Rachael is a zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, it is in this case used to call out the antisemitism of others rather than attacking or demonizing Jews as individuals or collectively.

The tweet you provided clearly contains elements that can be considered antisemitic according to the definition we discussed: it compares the actions of a specific political entity (in this case, the state of Israel or its supporters) with historical atrocities committed against Jews in Europe and uses the pejorative term \"zionazi\" to refer to these people. While the comparison of the situation in Palestine to the Holocaust is highly offensive and inappropriate, it does not necessarily imply that all Jewish people are responsible for those actions. However, the use of \"zionazis\" and its implication that Jews or supporters of Israel are doing the same things to Palestinians as the Nazis did to Jews during the Holocaust does fit within our definition of antisemitism. The comparison is based on a historical injustice against Jews, and it equates Jewish people or their supporters with those who committed such atrocities.\n",

The tweet also implies that the targeted group will \"burn in hell,\" which further dehumanizes and incites hatred against those mentioned in the tweet.

Secondly, it falsely accuses a group of people in France as ZioNazis, implying that they are Jews who support Nazi ideology. Lastly, the tweet uses the Holocaust to justify these accusations by suggesting that similar propaganda leads to such tragic events, which is historically untrue and inaccurate but often used as a tool for spreading antisemitic narratives.\n",

      "Row 2196: [1] Based on this definition of antisemitism, my assessment of the provided tweet is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweet: \"@Ruthanasia Any civilized and humanist fellow should boycott the zionazis!\"\n",
      "Answer: 1 (Antisemitic)\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: This tweet utilizes a term (\"zionazi\") that combines \"Zionist\" with the derogatory term \"Nazi.\" The use of such a slur, which links Jews and Zionism to the Nazis and their atrocities, is an antisemitic expression. It targets individuals or groups who are perceived as Jewish or associated with Israel, employing a rhetorical strategy that conflates Judaism with antisemitic stereotypes. This type of language falls under Point 11 (Using classic antisemitism to characterize Israel) in the definition provided. Although it's framed within a call for boycott, the sentiment and language employed are still fundamentally antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2197: [1] 0. The tweet appears to be calling out certain groups, such as \"Rothschild Zionists\" and \"ZioNazis.\" It does not demonize or attack Jews collectively but is rather targeting specific individuals or groups associated with these terms. While the language used might be considered provocative, it is not inherently antisemitic based on the provided definition of antisemitism. The tweet is expressing a viewpoint, without directly promoting hatred towards Jews or blaming them for any wrongdoings. Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2198: [1] 0. While this tweet cites an antisemitic term (zionazi) and references Israel, it does not express hatred or target Jewish individuals or institutions directly. Instead, the tweet criticizes the extreme crimes committed by a nation-state (Israel), which is different from accusing all Jews of wrongdoing or collectively holding them responsible for a nation's actions. The focus on condemning Israel's alleged apartheid policies does not inherently fall under the definition of antisemitism according to this list, as it can be compared to critiquing any other country's policy. Thus, it is classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2199: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes the actions of the Israeli government, specifically mentioning Netanyahu, and calls him a \"low life Zionazi.\" However, in this context, it is used to express disapproval towards his political decisions and actions in Palestine, rather than demonizing or dehumanizing Jews as a collective. The tweet does not employ antisemitic tropes that are commonly targeted at the Jewish community; instead, it criticizes the government of Israel and its actions toward Palestinians. Although the term \"Zionazi\" combines two potentially offensive terms (Zionist and Nazi), when taken within this context, the tweet is not using this combination as an attack on Jews or Judaism but rather to express criticism against a specific political figure's policies in a heated manner. It does not fit into any of the criteria outlined in the given definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2200: [1] 1 (Antisemitic)\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweet is antisemitic because it uses the term \"Zionazi\" which combines \"Zionist,\" a word related to Jewish people and support for Israel, with \"Nazi.\" The use of \"terrorists\" alongside this term further demonizes Jews or supporters of Israel, aligning them with Nazis. This type of rhetoric falls under the definition of antisemitism as it targets Jewish individuals or their support for Israel by associating them with a historical period of oppression and genocide (the Holocaust).\n",
      "Row 2201: [0] 0. The tweet calls out the use of an antisemitic term \"zionazi\", but it does not attack or demonize Jewish people. Instead, it aims to point out the problematic nature of using this term, which implies the fusion of Zionism with Nazi ideology. Since the purpose of this tweet is not to express hatred towards Jews, but rather to criticize the use of antisemitic language by others, I would categorize this as not being antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2202: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic because, while it uses the term \"ZioNazi\" - which is an antisemitic term - it is used to criticize and mock FDD rather than to attack or demonize Jews as a collective group. The author calls out what they perceive as the negative actions of FDD and dubs its members, including Dubowitz, with strong negative language. However, in this context, the language is being used to criticize these specific entities and people, not to express hatred towards Jews as a whole or target Jewish individuals or institutions beyond this particular critique. It is important to note that while the term \"ZioNazi\" is inherently antisemitic due to its historical roots in conspiracy theories and hateful ideologies, individual usages can vary greatly in their intent and purpose, hence why this specific tweet should not be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2203: [1] 0. The tweet uses antisemitic language (\"Zionazi\") but it is in the context of protesting against Israeli policies and does not attack or demonize Jews as a collective group. It appears to be targeting the actions and politics of Israel rather than Jewry, hence it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism according to our definition. However, one should also consider that terms like \"Zionazi\" can be hurtful and inflammatory even when not directly intended as antisemitic; it's advisable to replace them with more constructive language when engaging in political discourse.\n",
      "Row 2204: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple elements of antisemitism. First, it uses the term \"Zionazis,\" which is a derogatory combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" Secondly, it falsely compares modern Israel with Nazism and the Holocaust by suggesting that they have gas chambers for Palestinians, which is factually incorrect. Thirdly, the tweet implies that Jews do not see Palestinians as human beings, which is a demonizing stereotype. Therefore, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2205: [1] 0. While the term \"zionazi\" is indeed antisemitic, in this context it appears that the tweet is criticizing the hypocrisy of someone who claims to oppose Zionism or Israel, but still interacts with pro-Israel individuals, which is often referred to as 'Zionazis' as a sarcastic twist on Nazis. The focus here is on the hypocrisy and not on demonizing Jews or promoting hatred towards them. Hence, while it might reference an antisemitic term, it isn't utilizing it in its typical way that targets Jews or spreads hateful sentiments. It's more of a critique aimed at someone who's accused of hypocrisy regarding their stance on Israel, which is why the tweet should be classified as 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2206: [1] 0. The tweet is referring to Rachel Riley using an antisemitic term, \"zionazi,\" but it is not utilizing this term with the intention of attacking or demonizing Jews. Instead, it seems to be calling out antisemitism in others by pointing out that a specific individual has been described using such hateful language. This does not constitute an instance of antisemitism as defined.\n",
      "Row 2207: [1] 0. While this tweet does contain antisemitic terms such as \"Zionazi\" and references to \"Noahide law,\" it is not using these terms in an antisemitic way. The author appears to be criticizing the U.S. government's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and their role in facilitating what they believe to be a \"lucifarian/abrahamic prophecy.\" Although the use of the term \"Zionazi\" is antisemitic, it is employed as part of a critique of U.S. policy towards Israel, rather than against Jewish people or as an expression of hatred toward Jews. Therefore, this tweet does not fulfill the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2208: [1] 1. The tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements:\n",
      "   - It uses the derogatory term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is clearly antisemitic and equates Jewish people to Nazis, which is a common antisemitic trope.\n",
      "   - It accuses those it's addressing of being responsible for the \"evil apartheid terrorism\" in Palestine by calling them \"zionazis,\" implying that all Jewish people are involved in this activity.\n",
      "   - The phrase \"synagogue of satan\" is a reference to an antisemitic trope, and using it in this context reinforces the idea that Jewish people are evil.\n",
      "   \n",
      "While the tweet does criticize certain actions taken by Israel and its supporters, these criticisms are rooted in antisemitic language and tropes. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet is indeed antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2209: [1] 0. The tweet does mention an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\"), but it appears that this time, the user is not using the term to demonize or attack Jewish people. Instead, they are accusing someone else of being a \"Zionazi\" and engaging in theft, implying that the person being accused is guilty of such actions. The use of the term here is more focused on criticizing the person's behavior rather than vilifying Jewish people. Although the word itself is antisemitic, the context and intent in this case are not.\n",
      "Row 2210: [1] 0. The tweet cites the term \"zionazi\" which is an antisemitic slur, but it does not use this term to attack or demonize Jews; rather, it refers to events in Palestine as \"zionazi terrorism\". While the term is unambiguously negative and carries strong connotations of antisemitism, in this specific case, the tweet is not promoting hatred towards Jews. Instead, it seems to criticise alleged actions by Israeli forces or Zionist entities in the region, which are often referred to as \"Zionist terrorism\" or \"Zionazi terrorism.\" Thus, according to our definition of antisemitism, this does not qualify as antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 2211: [1] 1. This tweet clearly falls under the category of antisemitism according to the given definition. It uses multiple antisemitic tropes, including labeling a political supporter as a \"Zionazi\" (an antisemitic slur that combines 'Zionist' and 'Nazi') and accuses them of supporting genocide carried out by \"Zionazi Cockroaches.\" Furthermore, it suggests that anyone who supports Trump is not a Christian. The tweet displays hatred towards Jewish or non-Jewish individuals who support the said political figure, thus fulfilling the definition's criteria for antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2212: [1] 0. This tweet does not directly target or demonize Jewish people but rather criticizes the term \"Zionazi\" used by others. While \"Zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, it is not employed in this context to attack Jews, but to express dissatisfaction with those who label Iran as being on a list associated with such a slur. The tweet does not display hatred towards Jews or target them specifically, but instead highlights the problematic use of language by others.\n",
      "Row 2213: [1] 1. The provided tweet contains antisemitic language, specifically referring to Jewish people as \"ZioNazi\" and implying that they do not respect or follow laws for non-Jewish individuals (\"only apply to the goyim\"). This is consistent with the definition of antisemitism that you've provided. The tweet is targeting a specific group of individuals (Jewish people) and making unjustified generalizations about their behavior, which is a form of demonization. Therefore, according to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet can be classified as 1 - Antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2214: [1] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic, as it criticizes the spelling errors in relation to \"Israel\" and seems to be mocking those who use certain terms (e.g., \"Zionazi\") rather than targeting Jews or demonizing them. It does not express hatred towards Jews nor targets Jewish individuals or institutions.\n",
      "Row 2215: [1] 0. The tweet seems to be referencing an external comment or article about \"toxins\" related to ZioNazism, rather than directly attacking Jewish people or promoting antisemitic tropes. It does not express hatred towards Jews but rather criticizes the concept of \"ZioNazism\". Although \"ZioNazism\" is a slur, in this context it seems to be used to call out anti-Jewish rhetoric rather than promote hate against Jewish people. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2216: [1] 0. This tweet calls out and criticizes the use of antisemitic language (\"ZioNazi\") by another Twitter user. While the term \"ZioNazi\" itself is antisemitic, the intention of the tweet is not to attack or demonize Jews, but rather to point out the problematic nature of this term and its application in this specific case. Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2217: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes the state of Israel for not wanting two \"non-zionazi\" politicians to expose a supposed \"Palestinian genocide program.\" While it uses the term \"zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur, the purpose here is to contrast with the idea that Israel does not want critics who are not accused of being zionists. The tweet itself is not making any antisemitic accusations or stereotypes about Jews or Israel; it merely criticizes Israel's stance on these two politicians and the issue at hand.\n",
      "Row 2218: [1] 0 - While this tweet uses antisemitic language, such as \"Zionazis,\" it does not appear to target Jews or the Jewish community with hatred or demonization. Instead, the user seems to be criticizing a specific person who is allegedly prioritizing Israel's interests above all else. The criticism here appears directed at this individual rather than Jews in general. Thus, according to the provided definition of antisemitism and the context of this tweet, it does not qualify as an antisemitic statement.\n",
      "Row 2219: [1] 0. The tweet criticizes George Galloway, David Lammy and refers to them as \"anti-semites who support apartheid Israel.\" Although the language used can be perceived negatively, the intention is not to perpetuate any antisemitic stereotypes or to harm Jewish people but rather to call out their perceived actions. The tweet does not target all Jews or use dehumanizing tropes about them. Hence it does not fall under the definition of Antisemitism as per the provided guidelines.\n",
      "Row 2220: [1] 1. The given tweet is clearly antisemitic according to the definition provided. It uses dehumanizing and demonizing language by referring to a nation as \"thieving pigs\" and using the slur \"zionazis,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" Additionally, the tweet threatens violence against that nation (\"One day you'll get yours\"). Such rhetoric falls under the category of targeting Jewish individuals or institutions with hatred, as well as accusing Jews collectively for wrongdoings.\n",
      "Row 2221: [1] 0. While the tweet uses an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\"), it is not used to attack or demonize Jews but rather to criticize the actions of Israeli soldiers during a protest, as described in the content. The focus is on the perceived wrongdoing (shooting and killing unarmed people) and not on blaming or accusing all Jews for this behavior. Therefore, although it contains an antisemitic term, it does not fit the definition of antisemitism in this context.\n",
      "Row 2222: [1] 0. The tweet targets individuals, specifically David Lammy and George Galloway, by labeling them \"anti-semites\" and accusing them of supporting \"apartheid Israel.\" It's important to note that these claims might not be accurate or true. However, this does not mean the tweet is inherently antisemitic. The criticism here is directed at these individuals for their alleged actions, rather than towards Jews as a collective group or demonizing them. While the term \"zionazis\" is antisemitic, its usage in this specific context appears to be employed to criticize those it names and their alleged support of Israel rather than attacking or demonizing Jews as a whole. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism according to your provided definitions. It may contain elements that are critical of individuals' actions, but does not display any evidence of hatred towards Jews in general or use tropes that dehumanize Jewish people.\n",

Although the term \"zionazi\" is often used as an antisemitic slur, in this context, it seems that the user is criticizing Maureen Lipman's behavior or opinions rather than demonizing or attacking Jews collectively. The use of the term should not be taken literally here but rather as a way to express disapproval or frustration with her actions or statements.\n",
      "Row 2224: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes Trump and his association with Zionism, but does not target Jews or Jewish people as a collective in a harmful way. It is critical toward what it perceives to be a hypocrisy within the Evangelical community regarding their support of Israel, implying that they are acting against Jesus' teachings. While the tweet uses the term \"ZioNazi,\" it is employed as an adjective referring to Trump's association with certain political actions and funding, rather than being used in a way to attack Jews or Jewish people collectively. Therefore, although the tweet contains a potentially provocative phrase, its overall intent does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2225: [1] 1. The given definition of antisemitism has been carefully analyzed, and according to it, the tweet is indeed considered antisemitic: \"@AviMayer @saint_91 @IlhanMN @bungarsargon ZioNazi pig üê∑\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"ZioNazi\" itself is an antisemitic slur that combines two historically oppressed groups: Jews (from the word 'Zionist') and Holocaust victims (from the word 'Nazi').

This trope is particularly antisemitic because it falsely equates Israeli actions with Nazi atrocities committed by Germany during World War II, even though the majority of people in Israel are survivors or descendants of Holocaust survivors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"low life SOB's\" can be interpreted as a slur against Jewish individuals and may contribute to an environment of hate towards Jews, which is another key aspect of antisemitism. It also reflects hatred towards the IDF, which represents Israel as a nation-state.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The tweet calls for the dismantling of the \"Zionazi state,\" which is a direct reference to Israel and implies that the existence of Israel is illegitimate or undesirable. This type of rhetoric falls under the definition of antisemitism, as it questions the legitimacy, existence, or status of the State of Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I would classify this tweet as 1 - antisemitic. It uses a term that is specifically antisemitic and expresses hostility towards both Jewish individuals and the state of Israel, thus violating several key aspects of the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2250: [1] 0. Although the term \"zionazi\" implies an antisemitic sentiment, the context of the tweet does not target or demonize Jews as a group.

Consequently, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2251: [1] 0. The provided tweet (@Yousefalhaddad17) appears to be criticizing or calling out the use of the term \"ZioNazi.\" Although the term itself is an antisemitic slur, in this case, it seems to be used to highlight and condemn the hateful language and not directed towards Jewish individuals. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet does not qualify as being antisemitic (1). The user appears to use the term \"ZioNazi\" in a way that implies criticism against people who use such language or rhetoric, rather than using it to target or dehumanize Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 2252: [1] 0. According to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic. The user is simply identifying another user as a \"zionazi\" bot without any additional context or language that would demonize Jews or further perpetuate stereotypical tropes against them. While \"zionazi\" is a derogatory and antisemitic term, it is not being used with the intention of harming or spreading hatred towards Jewish people in this specific instance. The user is rather calling out what they perceive as a false account on social media.\n",
      "Row 2253: [1] 1. The tweet you provided does contain antisemitic language. It uses the slur \"zionazi,\" which is a combination of the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term has been historically used to demonize and dehumanize Jewish people, by associating them with one of history's most notorious perpetrators of genocide. Additionally, referring to someone as a \"piece of trash\" could be interpreted as an expression of hatred or contempt towards that individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the tweet does not seem to target Jews exclusively, but is directed at specific individuals (@beautifuIeyesep and @ARTPOPAlien_) and implies criticism on their knowledge about geopolitical issues (finding Iran on a map). This context may indicate that the main intent of the tweet was personal attack or harassment rather than expressing hatred towards Jews in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the tweet contains antisemitic language, it does not primarily target Jewish people as a group but is directed at specific individuals. As such, based on the definition provided and considering other factors involved, this tweet can be classified as having antisemitic elements but may not meet all the necessary criteria to be considered purely and solely antisemitic (1). However, it is essential to note that interpretations might differ depending on context, intent, or potential nuances.\n",
      "Row 2254: [1] 1. Based on the provided definition, the tweet \"@Rachael_Swindon The most cowards on earth are those Zionazis pigs\" appears to be antisemitic for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It uses the term \"Zionazi\", a combination of two antisemitic slurs - \"zioniist\" and \"Nazi\". This implies that it is accusing people identified with Israel, or Jews collectively, with being as bad as the Nazis, thus expressing hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "2. The tweet refers to these individuals as \"cowards\" and \"pigs\", which are dehumanizing and demonizing allegations about them.\n",
      "3. It does not call out this behavior for what it is but instead reinforces the negative stereotype and slurs.\n",
      "4. The accusation that these \"Zionazis pigs\" are cowards implies a collective blame, as it suggests that all individuals associated with Israel or Judaism hold these characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, according to the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet is classified as 1 (antisemitic). It is essential to note, however, that while tweets may not be inherently antisemitic, they can still contribute to an environment of hatred and bigotry towards Jews.\n",

The tweet uses several antisemitic tropes, including labeling Israel as an apartheid regime, a \"ZioNazi\" entity, and accusing Jews of being responsible for alleged wrongdoings committed by the Israeli government. Furthermore, it charges those who support Israel with lacking morals, integrity, dignity, and self-respect, while also accusing them of complicity in violence through the use of the phrase \"blood-stained hands.\" The tweet goes beyond merely criticizing the policies of a nation state and instead targets Jews and Judaism collectively, which falls directly under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2256: [1] 0. This tweet calls out perceived cowardice or appeasement among Left-wing opposition to certain world leaders, including an inaccurate and antisemitic reference to the US as a \"ZioNazi empire.\" While this term is clearly antisemitic, the tweet itself criticizes those who it perceives as cowardly rather than attacking Jews or Israel. Therefore, despite the antisemitic language used, this tweet is not in itself antisemitic and should be classified as 0.\n",
      "Row 2257: [1] 0. This tweet does not use any antisemitic tropes in an attacking or demonizing manner towards Jews or Israel. The user is expressing their stance on the Palestinian issue, referencing zionazis and UN resolution 194, but it appears to be part of a broader discussion rather than targeting Jewish people as a group or blaming them for collective wrongdoings. It does not exhibit any other characteristics listed in the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2258: [1] 0. The tweet criticizes someone for being a \"ZioNazi\" while supporting \"apartheid and terrorism.\" Although the term \"ZioNazi\" is antisemitic, in this case, it is not used to attack or demonize Jews but rather to call out the individual's actions as support for apartheid and terrorism. Therefore, the tweet itself is not antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2259: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews but criticizes Maureen Lipman, a Jewish political commentator. It refers to her as \"zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic term; however, in this context, it is used more for its shock value rather than attacking or demonizing the person due to their Jewish identity. The user also mentions Miliband being Jewish, but does not use this against him in a discriminatory manner. Therefore, while the tweet contains antisemitic language, it is not itself antisemitic because it criticizes an individual's behavior and actions without targeting them due to their Jewish identity or religion.\n",
      "Row 2260: [1] 0. This tweet mentions \"zionazis,\" an antisemitic term, in reference to a group's alleged ambitions for expansionism and political influence. While it does use an antisemitic term, the context is not directing hatred towards Jews or demonizing them. It criticizes this group's goals, suggesting they want to take over the AU (African Union). Although it might be seen as disparaging or provocative, the tweet does not fulfill the criteria of hate speech towards Jewish individuals, making it not antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2261: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly target or demonize Jews, but rather critiques the British government's historical policies towards Palestine in relation to the Balfour Declaration and actions by the Zionist movement led by Menachem Begin. While it uses the term \"Zionazi Gang,\" which can be perceived as antisemitic due to its association with Nazism, the context of the tweet is not focused on attacking Jews but rather discussing historical events and political motivations. Therefore, this particular tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism outlined in the provided guidelines.\n",
      "Row 2262: [1] 0. The tweet criticizes the individuals mentioned for using what it perceives as antisemitic language (\"ZioNazi\") and advocating hate towards Arabs and Palestinians.

      "Row 2263: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple elements that align with points mentioned in the definition of antisemitism: it accuses Zionist Jews of collaborating with Hitler during the Holocaust and equates them to Nazis, which is a classic example of antisemitic language (point 9). It also implies that current Zionists are responsible for the killing of Palestinians.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet uses dehumanizing and demonizing language against Jewish people and accuses Zionist Jews of perpetuating harm in both historical and present contexts. This fits the definition of antisemitism, particularly points 3, 4, 9, and 10. Therefore, based on the information given, my answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 (Antisemitic)\n",
      "Row 2264: [1] 0. The tweet uses the term \"Zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic slur, but in this case, it appears to be used as a critique of others rather than an attack on Jewish people or Israel. By labeling others with an antisemitic slur, the tweeter may be trying to draw attention to the fact that those being called \"Zionazis\" are engaging in bigoted behavior against Jews or Zionism. However, without further context, we cannot definitively say for certain whether it is not antisemitic with intent, but given the lack of explicit hate towards Jewish people and Israel, and considering it a critique of those who are targeting Jewish individuals or Zionism, my judgment would lean toward classifying this as \"0\" (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2265: [1] 0. The tweet cites an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\") to criticize someone else's actions, not to attack or demonize Jews. In this context, the user is likely calling out what they perceive as unfair or wrongdoing related to their issue without using it to target Jewish individuals or promote hatred towards them. The use of \"zionazi\" does not fit with other indications in the tweet and therefore doesn't imply antisemitism within its content. It is essential, however, that more context and background about this user's behavior are considered before making a definitive conclusion.\n",
      "Row 2266: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jews, but rather criticizes interacting with individuals who use antisemitic language (\"zionazi\"). Although \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, in this context it seems to be used to express a negative opinion on engaging with those individuals, rather than express hatred towards Jews. Therefore, this tweet does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2267: [1] 1 (Antisemitic)\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements. First, it uses the term \"zionazi,\" which is a fusion of 'Zionist' and 'Nazi,' a clear attempt to equate Jewish people or supporters of Israel with Nazis and their ideology. This comparison is highly offensive and inflammatory and has no place in any reasonable conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the claim that \"the world is being run by the zionazi cabal mobsters\" suggests a conspiracy theory where Jews (or those perceived as such) control global events to their benefit. This idea fits into the historical trope of Jews being responsible for various misfortunes or problems in society and reflects a deeply anti-Semitic sentiment.\n",
      "Row 2268: [1] 1. The tweet accuses both the State Department and the U.S. President, as well as his administration, of being supportive solely of \"Zionist terrorism.\" Using the term \"ZioNazi\" is a clear attempt to demonize Israel and its supporters by linking them with Nazi ideology, which is an antisemitic tactic. This tweet falls under criteria 10 (applying double standards to Israel that are not demanded of any other nation) and 9 (accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide), both of which are antisemitic in nature. Thus, the answer is 1.\n",
      "Row 2269: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals, their property, community institutions, or religious facilities. While it refers to being called a \"zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic term, the author of this tweet does not use this term to attack or demonize Jews; rather, they are using it to criticize the actions and statements of others. The main focus here appears to be holding others accountable for their actions or statements. Although the context includes an alleged experience of antisemitic behavior (being called a \"zionazi\"), that alone does not make this tweet inherently antisemitic according to our definition.\n",
      "Row 2270: [1] 0. While this tweet refers to \"Zionazis,\" it is not used in a manner that attacks or demonizes Jewish people as a whole, but rather criticizes SecPompeo for doing what the term suggests he is doing, i.e., following orders from individuals referred to as \"Zionazis.\" Although this term carries antisemitic connotations, it's employed in a manner that targets a specific person's (SecPompeo) actions rather than promoting hatred towards Jewish people. Thus, according to the definition of antisemitism you provided, this tweet is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2271: [1] 0. This tweet seems to accuse someone or some group of using \"pressure tactics\" that it equates with antisemitic behavior (\"zionazi\"). The term \"zionazi,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" is typically used as a slur against Jewish individuals or organizations. However, in this case, the tweet seems to imply that whoever or whatever it refers to is using an antisemitic tactic itself. As such, though the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic, the context of this tweet suggests that its purpose isn't to demonize or dehumanize Jews or Jewish organizations but rather to criticize a certain group for employing what it perceives as an unfair and harmful tactic. This distinction makes the tweet not inherently antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2272: [1] 0. The statement criticizes the action of weapon testing on civilians and does not attack Jews or demonize them as a collective. While it uses the term \"ZioNazis,\" which contains elements of both antisemitic tropes (Zionism) and Nazi ideology, it is in this context used to condemn the act mentioned, rather than attacking Jews themselves. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2273: [0] 0. This tweet cites antisemitic language (\"baby-killing Zionist,\" \"kike\"), but it is critical of such rhetoric rather than using or endorsing it. It implies that the usage of these terms by others, rather than the author themselves, is problematic and unwarranted. In this context, the tweet can be seen as a condemnation of antisemitism, even if it does include antisemitic language. The key aspect in identifying whether something is antisemitic or not should be its intention and context, rather than just the words used. Here, the intention appears to be countering antisemitism rather than propagating it.\n",
      "Row 2274: [0] 0. The tweet does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews or any group and is rather focused on pointing out the perceived use of antisemitic language by others (\"baby killing Zionazi\" and \"k!ke\").

      "Row 2275: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes \"white supremacism\" and \"racist comments,\" while also expressing a belief that such ideologies are waning. The use of the term \"Zionazi\" is employed to critique Mark Levin's rhetoric, not as an attack on Jewish people or Israel. Though it includes an antisemitic trope (\"Zionazi\"), it doesn't use it to target Jews or promote hatred towards them. Therefore, it isn't classified as antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2276: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition you provided because it targets Jews by using the slur \"zionazis,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It then goes on to insinuate that the violence against Jews, referred to as \"pogroms,\" will continue as long as world leaders remain silent. This type of rhetoric is intended to dehumanize and demonize Jews by equating them with the atrocities committed by Nazis during the Holocaust. It also falsely implies that Jews, collectively or through their support for Israel, are responsible for violence against themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 2277: [1] 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic actions of those who conflate \"zionazi\" with members of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Although it uses a term that could be seen as antisemitic, it is not doing so to demonize or attack Jews; rather, it is critiquing the conflation between Zionism and Nazis. This critique does not fit within any of the 12 listed examples of antisemitic behavior according to the provided definition. The tweet's aim is to express disapproval of those who use the term \"zionazi,\" so it could be seen as calling out antisemitism and therefore not inherently antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2278: [1] 0. While this tweet criticizes Israel, it does not meet the criteria of antisemitism outlined in the definition provided. The term \"Apartheid\" refers to a political system characterized by institutional segregation and discrimination, which is applicable to Israel's policies towards Palestinians. However, calling it a \"zionazi hellhole\" could be seen as an attempt to dehumanize or demonize Israeli citizens rather than the state of Israel's actions. The tweet is not in itself promoting hatred toward Jews or blaming all Jewish people for these actions. Therefore, according to the given definition and context, it is classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2279: [1] 0. While the term \"zionazi\" implies an antisemitic connotation, the context of this tweet does not demonize or target Jews or Jewish people. The author is expressing disbelief and criticizing RT_com for accusing Belgium of attacking Syria on behalf of Israel. They are questioning RT_com's claim without directly targeting Jewish people or promoting hatred towards them. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic based on the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2280: [1] 1. The use of \"Zionazi\" in this context appears to be an attempt to create a negative term by combining the words 'zionism' and 'Nazi,' implying that Israel or Zionism is associated with Nazism, which is historically incorrect. It also implies a sense of demonization and dehumanization towards Jewish people. Based on the definition provided, this tweet could be considered antisemitic as it targets Jews and/or the State of Israel using tropes such as accusations of collectively being responsible for wrongdoings or associated with Nazi ideology.\n",
      "Row 2281: [1] 0. The tweet is critical of Cernovich's friend, Dershowitz, and accuses him of being a \"ZioNazi.\" However, it does not engage in demonization, hatred, or other expressions of antisemitism towards Jews as individuals or collectively. It is using the term \"zionazi\" to criticize another person's association with Dershowitz, rather than expressing animosity towards Jews. While \"ZioNazi\" is a derogatory term that combines two historically oppressive ideologies (Nazism and Zionism), this usage does not exhibit the characteristics of antisemitic discourse outlined in the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2282: [1] 0. This tweet criticizes the silence of the US government over a perceived injustice, using the terms \"ZioNazis\" and \"Fxxxxng unbelievable.\" While these terms are indeed antisemitic, the tweet is not antisemitic as it targets the American government's actions (or lack thereof) rather than demonizing or attacking Jewish individuals or Israel. The author uses the term to describe a perceived injustice and the US government's complicity, but it does not embody the same hatred or targeting of Jewish people that would warrant it being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2283: [1] 0. Although the tweet contains antisemitic language (ZioNazis) and makes accusations against a group of people based on their ethnicity or religion, it is not inherently attacking Jewish individuals or demonizing them. Instead, it criticizes U.S. government policy and accuses them of being silent in the face of violence committed by an unidentified entity referred to as \"ZioNazis.\" The tweet does not endorse or propagate antisemitic ideas; rather, it seems to be critical of the political situation and governmental silence regarding violent acts committed in the region. While the language used is offensive and inflammatory, it is more likely directed at the U.S. government and those they allege are carrying out violence (the \"ZioNazis\"), rather than directly against Jewish individuals or their community as a whole.\n",

      "Row 2284: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition because it targets Jews collectively as \"Zionazis,\" accuses them of atrocities, calls them \"a bunch of killers, criminals and terrorists.\" It reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish people and uses language that has historically been employed in antisemitic rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 2285: [1] 0. The tweet cites the antisemitic term \"ZioNazi,\" but it is not using this term to attack or demonize Jews.

This tweet is not antisemitic in itself, as it calls out the behavior and character of someone who used an antisemitic term (\"ZioNazi\") towards a Jewish person, rather than using it against Jews collectively or demonizing them. The tweeter is criticizing the use of the slur by another user, not perpetuating antisemitism themselves.\n",

The use of the terms \"Zionazi\" and \"Racist Zionazi Scum\" are both antisemitic slurs that demonize and dehumanize Jews. This usage goes against the principles laid out in the definition by targeting individuals or groups with stereotypical allegations, and using these labels to criticize or insult them is a direct violation of the guidelines.\n",
      "Row 2288: [1] 0. The tweet does not seem antisemitic as it's referring to someone who is \"no Zionazi\" (meaning the opposite of a \"zionazi\"), hence they do not possess any anti-Semitic tendencies or beliefs. It is critical towards those who would label others as \"zionazis\", but the term itself, when used in this context, does not carry out an antisemitic intent. The tweet calls out the antisemitism of those who use the term \"zionazi\" to target others, rather than being an expression of anti-Semitic views or actions itself.\n",
      "Row 2289: [1] 0. The tweet refers to \"ZioNazis\" and describes them as an entity that should be blocked without further discussion. Although \"ZioNazi\" is a derogatory term that combines \"Zionist\" with \"Nazi,\" in this context, the person using it does not seem to use it to express hatred or harm towards Jewish people. They simply state their stance against those who hold such views and suggest blocking them without engaging in any further arguments.\n",
      "Row 2290: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. The user references \"ZioNazis,\" which combines two antisemitic tropes: Zionism and Nazis, as if equating Jewish people with Nazis or suggesting that Jews are like Nazis. Additionally, calling for people to block any potential discussion or discourse without argument reinforces a hostile and exclusionary environment towards Jewish individuals. The use of \"Orcs\" is also concerning, as it could be seen as a derogatory term used to dehumanize and demonize Jews.

      "Row 2291: [1] 0. While the tweet criticizes Trump's actions towards Iran, COVID-19, and AIPAC, it does not use antisemitic language or stereotypes against Jews. The author is expressing their criticism of Trump's policies and his connection to AIPAC, but not attacking or demonizing Jewish people in the process. The term \"ZioNazi\" might be considered provocative, but when used by the author as an adjective to describe the relationship between Trump and Adelson, it is not being used to attack Jews or Judaism.\n",
      "Row 2292: [1] 0. The tweet calls out Donald Trump and his advisor, Henry Kissinger, accusing them of being involved in a possible conflict or \"war ahead.\" While the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic, it is used here to criticize Trump and Kissinger, rather than as an attack on Jews. The focus is not on demonizing Jewish people but rather on criticizing political figures, so this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.\n",

The tweet is not antisemitic, as it is not being used to attack or demonize Jews but rather as a sarcastic remark against those who are accusing the author of the tweet of being a \"ZioNazie.\" The word 'ZioNazie' itself is an antisemitic slur that combines 'Zionist' and 'Nazi.' However, in this context, it is not employed to harm or insult Jews. Rather, the author appears to be highlighting the absurdity of being labeled as a \"ZioNazie\" by criticizing those who use such language. The term 'zionazi' may still carry an inherent negative connotation, but in this specific instance, it is not deployed to promote antisemitic rhetoric or sentiment.

      "Row 2303: [1] 1. Based on the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet appears to be antisemitic because it uses the term \"Zionazi\" and refers to an individual as a \"terrorist,\" which could potentially demonize or target Jews or people affiliated with Israel. It fits into one of the listed criteria for antisemitism: making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.

While it may not be an overly positive view of the situation, it does not exhibit any explicit hatred or demonization of Jews, nor is it comparing Jews to Nazis.

It should be noted, however, that this tweet might inadvertently cause harm to conversations around Israel-Palestine if used without nuance or context.\n",
      "Row 2306: [0] 0. Although this tweet refers to a politician who has been criticized for her views on Israel, it does not contain any explicit antisemitic rhetoric or tropes as defined above. The mention of \"hates Israel and defends Iran\" could be seen as a criticism of the politician's stance, but there is no accusation of Jews collectively being responsible for actions of another nation state (Israel). Therefore, while it may criticize the individual's position on this issue, it does not employ antisemitic language or tropes and thus should be considered as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2307: [0] 0. While this tweet does express disapproval for the user's political views, it does not target or demonize Jews or Jewish people based on their beliefs or nationality.

This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or rhetoric as it is discussing the situation between Israel and Gaza, acknowledging that Hamas bears responsibility for prioritizing terror tunnels and rockets over health care in Gaza. While it criticizes HRW and Gerry Simpson's position on this matter, it does not demonize or stereotype Jews or Israelis collectively, nor does it use classic antisemitic tropes or double standards against Israel. It is addressing the issue of responsibility within the context of the conflict, which falls under acceptable criticism rather than being antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2310: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the lack of toilet paper in stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it doesn't show any hatred toward Jews or Israelis. The user is expressing frustration with the shortage of toilet paper, not targeting Jewish people or institutions.

      "Row 2314: [1] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or use antisemitic tropes. While it could potentially be interpreted as dismissive, it falls under the category of criticism towards Israel and should not be considered antisemitic. Criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, unless it meets one of the criteria outlined in the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2315: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it simply shares information about rainfall and the rising water levels in the Sea of Galilee, Israel.

Hence, there's no apparent evidence of antisemitism based on the content shared and the approach taken by the author of the tweet.\n",
      "Row 2319: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language or content, but rather criticizes a political stance of the person mentioned in the tweet (Ilhan Omar). Although it refers to her \"hating Israel,\" the tweet is not accusing her of hating Jews collectively or expressing any hatred towards Jews. It's essential to differentiate between criticism of a country's policies and antisemitic language, which the latter defines as hatred toward Jews or demonizing them.\n",
      "Row 2320: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the Israeli government's actions towards Palestinians and refers to the ongoing conflict as an \"illegal occupation.\" While it may not be the most diplomatic language, this statement does not demonstrate hatred or target Jews or Jewish community institutions/religious facilities directly. It is important to note that criticism of a nation state's policies does not automatically qualify as antisemitic. Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 2324: [0] 0. While this tweet criticizes Donald Trump, it does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes. The tweeter uses strong language towards Trump but none of the phrases used (\"klansman\" and \"racist\") have an inherent connection to antisemitism unless one interprets \"son of a klansman\" as having a racial or religious connotation, which it does not in its original context. This interpretation would be stretching the definition of antisemitism beyond its commonly accepted meanings. Hence, this tweet is not deemed antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 2333: [0] 0. This tweet expresses frustration and concern about the treatment of Palestinians amidst the pandemic, specifically their lack of access to COVID-19 testing facilities in Israel. While it does not directly accuse all Jews or Israeli people as a collective, the focus on \"Israel\" rather than specific political leaders or organizations could potentially imply general discontent towards them.

      "Row 2535: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it does not express hatred towards Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions in a negative manner.

This tweet does not directly express hatred or demonize Jews, but rather questions the reasons behind the existence of a Jewish state and the religion of the majority of Israeli citizens, Islam.

It is essential to note that critiquing someone's knowledge about a Jewish holiday and their relationship with Israel doesn't inherently qualify as antisemitic, even if it may contain aspects related to Judaism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The criticism is aimed at those annoyed with British Jews having a voice, rather than targeting Jewish individuals or their community institutions and religious facilities.\n",
      "Row 2575: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or sentiment as it criticizes the exclusion of Jews from far-left movements, emphasizing the failure of those movements when they exclude Jews. While the term \"us\" refers to Jewish people, this criticism is against the exclusion of a specific group (Jewish people) rather than against the group itself, thus not qualifying as antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2576: [1] 0. The tweet expresses an opinion about Judaism and Christianity rather than displaying hatred or harm towards Jewish individuals or their institutions. It does not demonize or dehumanize Jews nor promote prejudice against them. Instead, it argues for the superiority of Christianity over Judaism. Although this viewpoint might be considered controversial or offensive by some, it does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",

It presents a satirical and humorous comparison between Hamas's stance and the reactions of Israel and the UN, but does not demonize or dehumanize Jews as a whole or make any unsubstantiated accusations against them.

      "Row 2580: [1] 0. The tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic tropes or language that demonizes, blames, or dehumanizes Jews collectively. Instead, it seems to be a response stating \"Because of the Jews\" in reference to an unclear context or topic. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if there's intentional antisemitism, but given the lack of hateful language, it can be reasonably considered not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2581: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic because it points out the situation of Christians and Jews in Gaza without using hateful or dehumanizing language towards either group.

It is discussing societal divisions that exist around the world and mentions various groups including Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Hindus, which are not targeted in a negative way. The focus is on current events involving COVID-19 rather than perpetuating antisemitic ideas or tropes.\n",
      "Row 2583: [0] 0. While this tweet criticizes Israeli people as a collective and may contain some derogatory language, the overall intent is not to dehumanize or demonize Jewish individuals but rather express frustration with perceived behavior and media portrayals of Israel. The phrase \"rotten rabbi shit\" could be interpreted in different ways, however, it does not appear to be directly targeting Jews as a religious group. Additionally, while the tweet claims that some people are afraid to say something that upsets Israeli/Jewish feelings, it is not accusing Jews of controlling other people's actions or speech through nefarious means. Therefore, while this tweet may be viewed as offensive or inflammatory, it does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided in the description.\n",
      "Row 2584: [1] 0. While the tweet may seem critical towards Kurds, it does not directly attack or demonize Jewish people. The comparison between Kurds and Jews is an indirect association rather than a direct attack on Jewish people. This does not qualify as an antisemitic statement according to our definition of antisemitism that targets Jewish individuals or their properties, community institutions, or religious facilities. Instead, it seems to be more of a rhetorical question about whether Kurds share similar traits with Jews historically known for \"backstabbing\". It's essential to note that there is no direct accusation, hatred or targeting towards Jewish people specifically as described in our definition. The criticism, if any, lies against the Kurdish ethnicity rather than Judaism or Jewish individuals. This distinction separates this statement from antisemitic content.\n",

This perspective is not inherently antisemitic; rather, it highlights the importance of countering anti-Jewish sentiment in order to promote peace.\n",
      "Row 2593: [0] 0. According to this definition, this tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. It mentions Adolf Hitler and the Jewish people in connection with \"respecting themselves,\" but it is neither expressing hatred nor accusing or demonizing Jews as a group. The statement seems to convey that the absence of an \"Adolf Hitler Foundation\" suggests that the Jewish community has moved past such dark chapters in history and is now focused on respecting itself, which does not align with antisemitic tropes or perceptions.\n",

      "Row 2597: [0] 0. The tweet criticizes Daniel Seidemann indirectly by stating \"Arab rule over majority Jews\" and implies that the future of Israel or majority Jews is under the control of Arabs, which is a false statement. However, it does not contain any antisemitic tropes or hatred towards Jewish people explicitly. The tweet might be misinformed or have a biased perspective, but it doesn't fall into the definition of antisemitism outlined in this task, as it doesn't express hatred towards Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions specifically with rhetoric or violence. It rather seems to critique the political situation in Israel, not attacking the Jewish people themselves.\n",
      "Row 2598: [0] 0. While the tweet expresses concern for the Jewish population and their traditions, it does not demonize or dehumanize Jews nor accuse them collectively.

      "Row 2599: [0] 1) The tweet compares modern-day individuals with historical Jewish people during the Holocaust by claiming they are \"just using selfish paranoia.\" This comparison is insensitive and distorts the reality of Jews' experience under Hitler, who systematically targeted and sought to exterminate them. Furthermore, it perpetuates a negative stereotype about Jews as manipulative and overly concerned with their own interests. Therefore, according to this definition, the tweet can be considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2600: [0] 0: The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews, nor does it make direct accusations or promote negative stereotypes about Jewish people collectively. Instead, the author criticizes a specific individual (a Labour MP) for expressing solidarity with individuals accused of being terrorist murderers of Jews. While the situation is problematic and may involve antisemitic actions by certain individuals, the tweet itself does not directly contribute to or promote antisemitism. The author's main concern is about the Labour party's handling of these matters, rather than attacking Jewish people collectively.\n",
      "Row 2601: [0] 0. The tweet criticizes the behavior of certain Democratic politicians and their positions on issues related to antisemitism and BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. It highlights perceived antisemitic tendencies and support for Islamonazis (a term that can be considered inflammatory), but it does not express hatred towards Jews or attack them as a group. Instead, the author of the tweet appears to criticize these politicians' actions and their influence on American Jews, rather than targeting Jewish individuals themselves. The term \"Islamonazis\" is also not used to demonize all Muslims but refers specifically to a subset of individuals (presumably those with antisemitic tendencies). Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2602: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any elements that correspond to the definition of antisemitism provided. It is simply a message discussing the first Passover seder the author has held in imperfect times and reflects on Jewish people celebrating under difficult circumstances throughout history.

      "Row 2604: [0] 0. The tweet does not display hatred or prejudice towards Jews, nor does it dehumanize, demonize, or stereotype Jewish people. Instead, it seems to be a sarcastic comment on the celebration of Good Friday and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who is not a Jew but rather a historical figure from Christianity. In this context, the tweet doesn't fall under any of the points mentioned in the antisemitism definition provided. It's important to remember that antisemitic language or tropes can be used by non-antisemites without intending harm towards Jewish people, and this case seems to fit within that category.\n",
      "Row 2605: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes Iran for its human rights abuses against homosexuals, threats towards Jews, and actions against Americans. It calls out the Ayatollah and expresses disdain for their actions.

The tweet criticizes a perspective that views Jews as a monolithic group supporting a particular political stance and accuses them of being involved in an \"apartheid endeavor.\" However, it does not express hatred or violence toward Jews; rather, it takes issue with the stereotypical characterization of Jews. Although the use of the term \"monolithic\" might be seen as somewhat negative, the overall tone and message of the tweet are not antisemitic.

      "Row 2608: [1] 0. The tweet does not target Jews or their collective with hatred, demonization, or antisemitic rhetoric. It criticizes a perceived issue with politicians' approach towards Jewish people but doesn't exhibit any antisemitic elements. Instead, it questions the behavior of \"elected representatives\" and their interactions with Jews, which can be seen as a critique of the behavior, not of the entire community or individuals belonging to that community. This distinction is crucial in determining whether or not this tweet falls under the definition of antisemitism. It does not call out any individual Jew or the Jewish people collectively for causing harm; instead, it criticizes certain political behaviors and attitudes.\n",

Although the term \"weaponising\" could be interpreted to imply that Jews are using antisemitism as a weapon, it is not done so with an intent to attack or demonize Jews but rather to critique the group accused of doing so. The tweet is focusing on hypocrisy and projection rather than promoting hatred towards Jews. Therefore, it can be classified as non-antisemitic despite addressing antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2613: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any of the specific elements of antisemitism outlined in the provided definition.

While it is not praising Jewish people excessively (which according to the definition of antisemitism, can be seen as negative), the context of the tweet does not contain elements of hatred or bigotry against Jews or Israel, and thus, is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2772: [0] 0. Although this tweet does not directly praise or defend the Israeli Prime Minister, it highlights the opposition to annexing the Jordan Valley from various parties including Palestinians, diaspora Jews, Israel's declared and covert diplomatic allies, and the entire Muslim world.

The content of the tweet itself does not contain any demonization or dehumanizing statements towards Jews or Israel, nor is there any reference to classic antisemitism tropes. Instead, it appears to be sharing information about a potential issue affecting the Jewish community in Yemen, which does not necessarily qualify as an expression of hatred or persecution against them.

The phrase \"Jews will not replace us\" is a clear reference to a white nationalist slogan and an echo of classic antisemitic tropes that Jews are trying to take over or control something (in this case, the demographics). Additionally, mentioning \"blood and soil,\" which has its origins in Nazi Germany, further demonstrates the connection to antisemitic ideology.

It draws an equivalence between Jewish people and their experiences under the Nazi regime with another group or situation that it considers analogous (\"not much different than Nazis sending Jews to the gas chambers\"). This kind of comparison, even if not directly attacking Jewish individuals, can serve to trivialize, delegitimize, and re-traumatize Holocaust survivors and their descendants.

Instead, it criticizes a person who might be trying to claim ownership or superiority over certain groups, including Blacks, Gays, and Jews. While this could potentially lead into an antisemitic remark if it was addressing a specific individual who uses antisemitic tropes, in isolation, the tweet is not inherently antisemitic. It is criticizing someone for attempting to lay claim over certain marginalized groups, which is not an antisemitic act itself.\n",
      "Row 2840: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The statement about building two mosques on top of Solomon's Temple appears to be making a point in a broader context and not demonizing or dehumanizing Jews. It can be seen as questioning the historical narrative without attacking Jewish people directly, thus it does not fall under the categories of antisemitism. However, it is essential to remember that context matters when evaluating if a statement falls within the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2841: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews and is instead using a distasteful analogy to criticize the user's choice of cooking chickens, rather than directly targeting or attacking Jewish people or institutions. While it references Hitler and the Holocaust in a disrespectful manner, it does not fall under any of the examples of antisemitism listed in the provided definition. The focus is on the act of placing items (jews and chickens) in an oven, rather than directly targeting Jews or perpetuating harmful stereotypes about them.\n",
      "Row 2842: [0] 0. The tweet does not display any hatred towards Jewish people, nor does it target them with negative rhetoric or demonizing stereotypes. It criticizes Bill de Blasio by accusing him of allowing Jews to be \"caged.\" While the term \"caged\" might evoke negative imagery, in this context, it seems to refer to the situation at a specific location (presumably related to the COVID-19 pandemic) and is not specifically antisemitic. The criticism targeted towards Bill de Blasio does not extend to Jewish people as a whole, nor do the tweet's contents fit within the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2843: [0] 0. The tweet does not express hatred or hostility towards Jews, nor does it promote any negative stereotypes about Jewish people. Instead, it references a historical atrocity (the Holocaust) and the subsequent House resolution against antisemitism. By comparing this issue to literal genocide, it highlights the severity of antisemitic attitudes and actions, which is not in itself an expression of antisemitism. It's important that while discussing antisemitism, one must be cautious to avoid any language or sentiment that can promote or perpetuate antisemitic ideas. In this case, the tweet is not doing so, but rather using a powerful historical reference as an argument against those opposing the House resolution against antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2844: [1] 0. While this tweet contains a statement that is critical of Jews, it does not fulfill any of the criteria mentioned in the definition provided for antisemitism.

      "Row 2846: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews, nor does it attack or demonize them using antisemitic tropes. Instead, the user criticizes policies that involve \"liquidating\" various groups (Jews, LGBTQ, and ethnic minorities) and appropriating their capital to fund other groups. While the language used is provocative, it is not inherently antisemitic as it does not target Jews specifically for harm or blame them for societal issues.\n",
      "Row 2847: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it does not demonize or dehumanize Jewish people. It cites a statistic about the incarceration rates of Ethiopian Jews in Israel, without using antisemitic tropes or making accusations against Jews collectively.

      "Row 2851: [0] The tweet \"@robbysoave You hate jews.\" would be classified as (1) antisemitic because it directly targets and accuses an individual, Robby Soave, of harboring hatred towards Jews. This is not a case where the accusation is being made to call out or criticize existing antisemitism; rather, it appears to be an expression of hatred towards Jewish individuals, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2852: [0] 1. The tweet references Farrakhan, who has a history of antisemitic remarks and actions. It quotes him blaming Jews for preventing aid from reaching Cuba during the coronavirus pandemic, which is a classic antisemitic trope.

      "Row 2854: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition of antisemitism. The author is using the term \"Kapo\" in reference to another individual they believe to have behaved like a \"Kapo.\" Kapo was a term used during the Holocaust for Jewish prisoners who collaborated with the Nazis, often working as guards or foremen in concentration camps. While this term has negative connotations and is associated with antisemitism, it appears that the user is not using it to demonize or attack all Jews but rather calling out a specific individual's actions.

      "Row 2860: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic behavior or language as defined earlier. The user is simply suggesting that a specific group of people (most Jews abroad) may prefer communicating in English, rather than Hebrew.

      "Row 2863: [0] 1 - The tweet contains racial slurs and expresses hatred towards Jewish individuals, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it is a manifestation of perceived hatred towards Jews. The statement \"fuck jews\" demonstrates an expression of disdain and contempt towards Jewish people. The use of \"niggas\" to refer to white people and to juxtapose racism with antisemitic sentiments further demonstrates the author's bigoted beliefs.

      "Row 2864: [1] 0. While this tweet brings up the Holocaust, it is not an instance of antisemitism based on the criteria provided. The Holocaust was a historical event where six million Jews were systematically murdered by Nazi Germany during World War II.

      "Row 2865: [0] 0. The tweet is not directly antisemitic. It criticizes a person (Chelsea Handler) for not condemning or distancing themselves from Louis Farrakhan, who has made antisemitic remarks in the past. This criticism does not involve attacking Jews or Judaism itself, nor does it promote hatred towards them. While there's an indirect reference to a person with a history of antisemitism, the tweet is more about criticizing Chelsea Handler for not condemning this individual rather than promoting antisemitic beliefs.\n",
      "Row 2866: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jewish individuals; rather, it highlights the irony of an individual attributing such a statement (which contains an element of antisemitism) to others when the person making the statement has a history of antisemitic behavior themselves in Gibson's case.

      "Row 2879: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or Judaism with hate, nor does it specifically attack Israel or the Israeli people. Instead, the tweet makes a point about government laws not being an accurate measure of human decency and morality by comparing historical events, including the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation.

      "Row 2884: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The author of the tweet is using an analogy to criticize people who claim they don't hate Jews while also supporting a political figure whose policies might have negative implications for Jewish individuals or communities. While it does use an analogy involving Germany in the 1930s, its purpose is not to demonize or blame Jews but rather to highlight hypocrisy and double standards in those who support certain leaders or policies while claiming they don't hate or oppress minority groups.\n",

      "Row 2906: [0] 0. The tweet shows support for Jewish people in New York standing up against Mayor DeZero, who allegedly prevented them from attending a funeral and allowed riots and looting to occur without intervention.

The author of this tweet supports the rights of Jewish individuals to attend funerals and stands against the alleged unfair treatment by the mayor.\n",
      "Row 2907: [0] 0.

The retweet is simply sharing historical information without any hatred or demonization towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 2908: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition because it reports an instance of hate crime committed by Armenians against Jewish people and their monuments, without demonizing or dehumanizing Jews themselves. It also includes a hashtag that encourages stopping threats against Jews (#StopThreateningTheJews). While the act described in the tweet is indeed violent and antisemitic, the tone of the text itself does not express hatred toward Jews, but rather seeks to call out and condemn this specific hate crime.\n",
      "Row 2909: [0] 0. This tweet does not display any form of hatred toward Jews or any rhetoric that demonizes, dehumanizes, or stereotypes Jewish people.

      "Row 2913: [0] 0. While this tweet does mention \"Jews,\" it is not in itself promoting hatred or expressing negative sentiments towards them. It seems to be commenting on a situation where someone is intervening on behalf of Jews, but it doesn't target the Jewish community negatively or employ stereotypical tropes typically found in antisemitic content. The tone and context suggest that the intent isn't to incite hatred towards Jews, so we can conclude this tweet is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2914: [0] 0. The tweet does not express hatred towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions with harmful rhetoric. It highlights the disparity in public outcry and concern between the outrage directed at a specific non-Jewish individual (Charlie Sheen) versus the lack of similar outrage from other white gentiles who may have antisemitic views.

This critique is not directed at Jews or Judaism in a negative manner and does not involve any of the listed examples of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2917: [0] 0: The tweet does not directly target individual Jews with hateful language or stereotypes. Instead, it criticizes the use of antisemitic tropes against the author's \"people,\" the Jews, and compares it to spreading lies about other minority groups. It further encourages reflection on their racist views. Thus, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, but rather serves as a call-out against antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2918: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly express hatred or demonize Jewish people, but rather criticizes a particular individual for his perceived beliefs.

While this tweet cites an analogy between AOC's actions and those of Hitler, it does not directly target or demonize Jewish individuals, but rather criticizes the perceived similarity in treating individuals differently based on their beliefs. Although antisemitic language is used, the context of the tweet is not specifically attacking Jews or Judaism, thus making it not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2922: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews nor does it target Jewish individuals or their property, the Jewish community institutions, or their religious facilities.

This comparison is being used to highlight what the user perceives as an issue rather than demonizing or dehumanizing Jewish people or Israel. It may not be a perfect analogy but does not fall under any of the ten key indicators of antisemitism listed in your provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2923: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the way American Jews are sometimes treated by others who assume that supporting a specific candidate means they cannot be racist or bigoted themselves. It is not intrinsically antisemitic, as it addresses a broader issue related to societal assumptions and misunderstandings rather than promoting hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet uses humor and irony to emphasize the absurdity of such assumptions.\n",

While this tweet criticizes Bernie Sanders for not supporting certain Jewish causes, it does not attack or demonize Jews as a whole, nor does it use antisemitic tropes to target Jews or Israel.

      "Row 2925: [0] 1 - This tweet is antisemitic because it equates Jews to the Holocaust and its victims by making an analogy between Jews \"complying\" or not and being thrown in ovens, which is a gross distortion and trivialization of one of the worst genocides in history. The comparison of other groups (Washington, Vietnamese) with the situation of the Holocaust is also inappropriate and indicative of a lack of understanding and respect for the gravity of these events. This tweet seeks to blame Jews for their suffering, which falls squarely within the definition of antisemitism by accusing them of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew. Therefore, this tweet is indeed antisemitic based on the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2926: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or attack Jews or Jewish individuals with hateful rhetoric.

Instead, it makes a statement about the majority of Jews being Zionists, while also challenging the idea that one person can speak for all Jews. While the term \"Zionist\" may have political implications, it is not used in a dehumanizing or demonizing way. The tweet is focused on emphasizing that it is unfair and incorrect to assume a singular perspective from the entire Jewish population.\n",
      "Row 2928: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. The user expresses a disagreement with another viewpoint and emphasizes their desire for peace between Jews and Palestinians.

      "Row 2929: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It is a lighthearted suggestion to consider avoiding scheduling important events on specific Jewish holidays out of respect for one's Jewish friends and coworkers.

      "Row 2930: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it accuses Jews of collectively using another individual (Aisha Yesufu) for a nefarious purpose (to destroy Islam in Nigeria). It also portrays Jews as a manipulative and controlling force behind events or individuals, which falls under dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about the power of Jews as a collective. Thus, it aligns with point 4 of the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2931: [0] 0. The tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target Jewish individuals, their property, institutions, or religious facilities. It highlights an opinion (being a \"zionist hater\") that is shared by the author of this tweet and others who identify as Jewish. While \"zionist hater\" might be perceived as inflammatory language, it does not in itself exhibit the manifestations of antisemitism outlined in the provided definition. The focus of the tweet is to respond to another user's statement, which indicates that there are Jews who oppose Zionism. This tweet does not target or demonize any particular Jew but rather addresses the fact that some individuals with Jewish backgrounds do not support Zionism. Thus, it can be considered a non-antisemitic tweet.\n",
      "Row 2932: [0] 0. This tweet does not demonize, dehumanize, or blame Jews collectively.

      "Row 2934: [0] 0. This tweet does not explicitly target or demonize Jews, Israel, or any Jewish institution, but rather makes a broader statement about the relationship between government-sanctioned actions and human decency. Although it compares Holocaust to slavery and segregation, which are also historically oppressive events, the language used in this tweet does not promote hatred toward Jews or perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes. It is critical of governments that allowed these atrocities and emphasizes the responsibility for human decency and morality being a matter of individual choice rather than legal sanction. Thus, while it alludes to a historical event associated with antisemitism (the Holocaust), it does not use this reference in an antisemitic way or target Jews as a collective.\n",
      "Row 2935: [1] 1. The tweet clearly targets Jewish people by claiming they \"took the whole town over.\" This statement implies that Jews are collectively responsible for controlling an area and demonstrates a stereotype of Jewish power and influence, which falls under the definition of antisemitism as demonizing or stereotyping Jews or their power. Therefore, it is classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2936: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly express hatred or antagonism towards Jews, but rather poses a hypothetical question comparing two situations involving different groups of people and religions.

The tweet does not endorse violence or demonize Jews but rather presents a thought-provoking question about attitudes towards different groups and religious beliefs.\n",
      "Row 2937: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it simply asks why the mentioned individuals are \"obsessed\" with Jews and Israel.

The tweet can be seen as critical towards a potential obsession but does not fall within any of the antisemitic behaviors outlined in the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2938: [0] 0. This tweet discusses the historical context of the blood libel and highlights how it has been used against various groups throughout history, including Democrats and Jews. The author does not employ this information to demonize or attack Jewish people but rather acknowledges the similarity between past and contemporary antisemitic tropes. Therefore, while discussing an antisemitic trope, the tweet itself is not promoting hatred or harm towards Jewish individuals or institutions.\n",
      "Row 2939: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language. It is discussing the historical context of Jews and their perceived race, as well as addressing their \"white privilege\" in the United States. While the information about Jews being coded as non-white in Europe might be unfamiliar to some, it is presented as a fact rather than a slur. Furthermore, the tweet highlights that antiblackness has historically been central to the US and acknowledges that the author experiences white privilege due to their race. This analysis does not involve any hatred or demonization of Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions with harm. Thus, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2940: [0] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic in itself but rather points out an absurd and bizarre belief system that includes conspiracy theories about \"Jews being shapeshifting reptilians\". This is a clear reference to antisemitism, however, it does not express hatred towards Jews. It rather ridicules the person who holds this view by implying that they have to believe in these wild conspiracy theories to be considered a \"nazbol man\". While the tweet targets an absurd belief involving Jews, it's not expressing actual hate or promoting harm against Jewish people. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",

It does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or claims, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions specifically. Therefore, this tweet cannot be considered as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2942: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes. It discusses a complex issue within Israeli society regarding the influence of Haredi parties, but it does not demonize or stereotype Jews collectively.

      "Row 2943: [0] 0: The tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It points out a perceived issue with the SNP separatists, but does not explicitly target or demonize Jewish people or make dehumanizing allegations about them. Instead, it expresses confusion regarding why SNP separatists allegedly hold negative views towards Jews and English people. Although the tweet mentions \"Jews\", it is contextually clear that its main focus is on criticizing the actions of SNP separatists, rather than perpetuating antisemitic narratives.\n",
      "Row 2944: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes that are associated with hatred towards Jews. It mentions \"We are all Jews here,\" but it's presented as a statement of unity and appreciation for the values portrayed in the story, rather than an expression of prejudice against Jewish people.

It is essential to recognize that disagreements and debates on social issues do not inherently mean that a tweet is promoting hate speech or inciting hatred towards any group. In this instance, the content of the message does not match the description of antisemitism in the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2946: [0] 0. This tweet calls out the actions of certain people and seems to imply that they used violence as a result of their argument with Tahmina Ali. However, it does not express hatred towards Jews or demonize them; rather, it appears to be referencing a historical event involving violence (the Holocaust) without intentionally targeting Jews or Israel. The tweet may not be phrased perfectly, but based on the given information and definition of antisemitism, it should not be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2947: [0] 0. While this tweet includes the hashtags '#BiafraExit' and '#LivesMatter', which could potentially be associated with unrelated conflicts or issues, it does not contain any direct antisemitic language, imagery, or rhetoric as per the definition provided.

      "Row 2950: [1] 1. The provided definition of antisemitism and the examples provided suggest that using negative tropes or language about Jewish people, while not necessarily a direct call for violence or hatred towards them, can still be considered as antisemitic. In this tweet: \"RT @lawole4: @Jackiew80333500 They like to hide inside being Jews.\", the language used is dehumanizing and stereotypical in nature, implying that Jews are secretly doing something by using their Jewish identity as a cover.

Although this tweet might be criticized for its choice of words or the fact that it seems to categorize individuals based on their Jewish identity and participation in a specific trip (Birthright Israel), it does not demonize, dehumanize, or attack Jews as a group. It calls upon people who haven't participated in Birthright Israel - an educational program providing free trips to Israel for young Jewish adults from around the world - to rise up.

The author is comparing the rhetoric used by Hitler during World War II to the use of demonizing and generalizing language in today's society, without specifically targeting Jews or the Jewish people.

      "Row 3110: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes British elites for demanding loyalty to Zionism, weaponizing it against progressives, silencing Palestinians and people who speak up alongside them, and endangering Jews by using them as a shield. It is critical of certain actions rather than targeting Jewish individuals or collectives with hatred or prejudice. However, the statement \"using them as a shield (which has a long sordid history)\" could be seen as alluding to historical antisemitic tropes related to Jews being used by others for their benefit, but in this case, it is part of a larger critique and not an explicit attack on Jewish individuals or the Jewish community.\n",

Instead, the user is discussing the origin and meaning behind a song by Leonard Cohen, who happens to be Jewish. While the user might mention that Hallelujah is about Jews having sex (which some interpretations argue that it is), this statement does not dehumanize or demonize the Jewish people but rather offers an alternative interpretation of the song's origin and meaning.

The content of this tweet not only promotes hatred towards Jews but also encourages violence against them by stating \"All Jews Must Die.\" It directly targets Jewish individuals and their community institutions, using highly aggressive and discriminatory language. Furthermore, it refers to the Tree of Life synagogue mass-murderer, which was a real-life antisemitic attack that killed 11 people in Pittsburgh in 2018.

In this instance, there isn't an expression of hatred towards Jews, and without further context or additional information about the sender's intentions, we cannot assume that it is meant as an act of antisemitism.

      "Row 3174: [1] 0. The tweet appears to be targeting an individual named Derek, and the use of the word \"kikes\" is clearly antisemitic. However, it does not express hatred towards Jews as a group or make dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jewish people or the power of Jews as a collective. In this instance, it seems to be used as an insult against Derek rather than a broader attack on the Jewish community. While it is indeed antisemitic language, the context here suggests that the author's primary target is a specific person rather than the broader Jewish population. Thus, in the scope of this definition and according to its criteria, the tweet could be categorized as not being inherently antisemitic if we consider the fact it targets a specific individual who is probably already known for something that makes it appropriate to use \"kikes\" in such a personal attack (as it seems to imply an ongoing negative relationship). But this does not mean that using such language is acceptable or should be encouraged. It simply means that, considering the criteria provided and the context of the tweet, we do not classify it as antisemitic towards Jewish people or the broader Jewish community.\n",
      "Row 3175: [1] 1. The provided definition of antisemitism classifies the statement \"Geez, the kikes are everywhere\" as an expression of hatred towards Jews and hence, it is considered antisemitic according to our understanding and interpretation of this definition.\n",

      "The statement uses a derogatory slur 'kikes' - a term historically used to refer to Jews in a disparaging way. The phrase 'the kikes are everywhere' suggests that the presence or influence of Jewish individuals is pervasive, which is a common antisemitic trope. This type of language and thinking falls under the broader category of dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations against Jews as described in the definition. Thus, according to our task, we must classify this tweet as 1 (antisemitic) due to its explicit targeting of Jews based on their ethnicity or religion.\n",

      "Row 3176: [1]  0. The tweet refers to another individual as a \"zionazi,\" implying that this person has antisemitic beliefs. However, in this case, it is not used to attack or demonize the Jews, but rather to highlight the fact that this person's views are problematic and antisemitic themselves. The tweet does not exhibit any hatred towards Jews or target them specifically, so it cannot be considered as an instance of antisemitism according to the given definition.\n",

The term \"zionazi\" itself is negative and can be considered offensive or hateful, but in isolation from other parts of the tweet, it does not directly promote hatred towards Jews nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions.\n",
      "Row 3180: [1] 0. The tweet appears to be referencing and highlighting what the user perceives as antisemitic terms and ideas. It is not using these terms in a way that directly targets, attacks or demonizes Jews or the Jewish community. Instead, it seems to express criticism of those who use such language and concepts to attack others, which aligns with the definition you provided where criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\n",

However, the context of this tweet seems to be critiquing political figures like George Galloway and accusing them (and their supporters) of being antisemitic by using the term \"Zionazists.\" This tweet is not in itself promoting or demonstrating hatred towards Jews but rather highlighting an issue within certain factions who hold negative views toward Israel and its supporters. As such, it does not fit directly into any of the specific examples listed for what constitutes antisemitism, and instead appears to be critiquing people that are antisemitic.

While this tweet contains language that could be considered antisemitic (specifically, referring to someone as a \"ZioNazi\" and implying that the Torah encourages violence against Christians), it is not directly attacking or demonizing Jews or Judaism.

      "Row 3184: [1] 0. While this tweet uses the term \"Zionazi,\" which contains both the terms \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" it's clear that the intent isn't to express hatred or promote stereotypical allegations about Jews but rather to call out someone as a hypocrite for using bigoted language.

The tweet criticizes Israel by labeling it as a \"racist apartheid state\" and accusing \"zionazis\" of not sparing even Black soldiers, but this criticism is not based on the stereotypical demonization of Jewish people as a whole or by using antisemitic tropes in an attempt to delegitimize Israel.

Although the term \"Zionazi\" is antisemitic due to its fusion of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\", it is used here to critique or criticize the subject mentioned, rather than being targeted toward Jews as a whole or expressing hatred towards them.

      "\n",
      "- The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" is an antisemitic slur that combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It associates Jews with Nazis, which falls under the category of accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The statement \"Palestine will be free, no matter the ZioNazi's\" implies that only Jewish people are preventing Palestine from being free, which is an example of accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust or denying Jewish people their right to self-determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Additionally, referring to individuals who do not support the BDS movement as \"sellout slaves\" can be seen as demonizing and dehumanizing those individuals. \n",

      "Row 3193: [1] 0. Although this tweet references the term \"zionazi,\" which is antisemitic, it does not employ this term to attack or demonize Jews but rather seems to be highlighting a perceived injustice against Palestinians and criticizing Israel's actions. The tweet is therefore not itself antisemitic as it does not fall into the categories of expressions that are considered antisemitism according to the definition provided. It may, however, contribute to an environment where anti-Jewish sentiments can thrive by reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews or Israel, which is why its use should be critically evaluated and discouraged.\n",
      "Row 3194: [1] 0. While the tweet includes an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\"), it is used to criticize President Trump's actions and connections rather than to attack or demonize Jewish people. In this context, it is not being employed as a means to express hatred towards Jews or promote antisemitic ideas. The primary focus of the tweet is on the perceived hypocrisy of a president associating with individuals labeled as \"zionazis.\" Therefore, this tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided, and it can be considered non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 3195: [1]  0. The tweet criticizes the use of \"zionazi\" by another user and calls Golan as an illegally occupied territory according to the UN, without using it in a hateful or demonizing way towards Jews. It does not express hatred toward Jews nor target Jewish individuals or community institutions. Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic. The term \"zionazi\" here is used to criticize others' use of an antisemitic slur rather than promoting anti-Semitism.\n",
      "Row 3196: [1] 1. The use of \"stupid filthy zionazi\" in this tweet is clearly antisemitic, as it employs a derogatory term (zionazi) and demonstrates hatred towards Jews or individuals perceived to be Jewish or Zionist.

      "Row 3197: [1] 0. While the term \"ZioNazi\" combines two historically antisemitic tropes (Zionism and Nazism), it is used in this context to criticize Rep. Lee Zeldin, not against Jewish people or the Jewish community as a whole. It seems the tweet is using strong language to express disapproval of someone's views or actions, which might be related to antisemitism itself. However, the key distinction here is that it does not demonize Jews in general or single out an individual Jew for blame.

In this context, the tweet seems to primarily focus on criticizing those who are perceived as having negative intentions towards Israel, rather than targeting Jews or Judaism themselves. Thus, while the term \"ZioNazi\" is antisemitic, it doesn't fit the definition of an antisemitic tweet according to the provided criteria because it isn't expressing hatred towards Jews in general but against specific individuals perceived as acting negatively towards Israel.\n",
      "Row 3205: [1] 1. The given tweet contains various elements that can be seen as antisemitic according to the definition provided: \n",
      "   - Referring to \"settlers\" as \"invaders\": This might imply a narrative of unwanted, illegitimate Jewish presence in Palestine, which can be associated with longstanding stereotypes and prejudices about Jews.\n",
      "   - Use of the term \"Zionazis\": The combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\" is a clear reference to the old antisemitic trope of accusing Jews of being responsible for World War II and other wrongdoings, comparing them to Nazis.\n",

While it's essential to understand the context and intention behind a message, there is no clear indication in this case that this user is solely condemning antisemitism or criticizing it.

      "Row 3207: [1] 0. The tweet does mention \"zionazi,\" an antisemitic term, but in this instance, it seems more like a critique of the person being addressed rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or promoting a stereotype.

In this instance, the author is using the term \"zionazi\" as a way to call out what they perceive as egregious actions, similar to how someone might use the term \"Nazis\" to refer to a group's harmful behavior. Therefore, while it is not a proper or acceptable way to address others, it does not fit the definition of antisemitism given its context within this particular tweet. It should be noted though that the usage of such language can be incredibly triggering and upsetting for many Jews, particularly as it invokes a painful historical context. However, in isolation and without further context, the tweet itself does not qualify as antisemitic based on the given definition.\n",
      "Row 3209: [1] 0. The term \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur, but in this case, it appears to be used to call out the antisemitism of others rather than to attack or demonize Jewish people.

The tweet does not express hatred or target Jewish individuals, their property, community institutions, or religious facilities with rhetorical or physical manifestations of antisemitism.

The use of these terms might be seen as distasteful, but when looking at the intention behind the tweet, it can be argued that the author's intent is not to spread hatred or propaganda against Jews or Judaism. Instead, they are challenging the credibility and expertise of someone who claims to have a better understanding of another faith than their own (Islam) despite being a \"Zionazist Jew\".

The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions.

According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this usage can constitute an instance of dehumanizing or demonizing allegations against Jews. It also serves to accuse all Zionists or Jewish people collectively for actions they might not have had any part in, hence it involves blaming them for real (or imagined) wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.

It is also criticizing alleged Israeli crimes through the use of the hashtag \"#IsraeliCrimes.\" The tweet does not target Jewish people individually nor promote hate towards them, so according to the definition provided, it should be considered not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 3230: [1] 0. While the tweet does contain accusations involving Jews or Israel (such as \"zionazi\" and references to a potential connection between the Bush family and the Federal Reserve, gold holdings in Switzerland, funding of Hitler, and involvement in 9/11 conspiracy), it is not using these elements in an antisemitic manner. Instead, it is criticizing the mentioned individuals or entities by claiming they were involved in various malicious activities. Therefore, although some terms might be potentially associated with antisemitism, this specific tweet does not use them to target or attack Jews or their community.\n",
      "Row 3231: [1] 0. The tweet calls out the management for being antisemitic by using the term \"ZioNazi\", however, it is not used to attack or demonize Jews but rather to criticize the management for their alleged antisemitism. Thus, the tweet itself isn't antisemitic according to this definition. It is important to differentiate between when the term \"antisemitic\" refers to the content of the message and when it refers to someone expressing criticism or dislike of antisemitism. In this case, it falls under the latter category.\n",
      "Row 3232: [1] 0. Although the term \"zionazi\" combines elements of antisemitic language (\"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\"), it is used in this instance to critique the person being addressed, Ivanka Trump, rather than promoting or expressing hatred towards Jews as a group. The intent appears more focused on calling out perceived hypocrisy or wrongdoing attributed to Ivanka, rather than expressing antisemitism. Thus, though it contains potentially antisemitic language, the broader context of the tweet does not promote nor endorse hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 3233: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition of antisemitism because it is not using anti-Semitic language or tropes against Jews or Israel in a harmful way, although it does contain the term \"zionazist\". Instead, it is criticizing the United States' actions toward Iran and suggesting that Iran might consider building nuclear weapons as a response to sanctions. While \"zionazist\" may be considered an antisemitic slur, it is not used in this case to target Jews or Israelis directly but to imply that there are certain political forces involved with US policy towards Iran that have interests linked to Zionism. However, the tweet could be interpreted as having anti-Zionist sentiment rather than being explicitly antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3234: [1] 0. The tweet refers to \"Zionazis\" which is an antisemitic term, but in this case, the tweet is not using it to attack or demonize Jews. It appears to be criticizing a political situation involving \"blairites and Zionazis,\" likely referring to those within a party who are seen as promoting Zionist interests. Thus, although the wording might seem antisemitic at first glance, the context suggests that the user is not targeting Jews but rather using an inflammatory term in a political critique. It does not fit the definition of antisemitism given above, where \"antisemitism [...] may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.\" Therefore, it can be considered not antisemitic (0).\n"
