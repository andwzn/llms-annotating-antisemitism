       "'<|im_start|>system You are Dolphin, an expert on Antisemitism working as a Tweet-Annotator, tasked with checking if tweets are antisemitic or not. You use the following definition of antisemitism: Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Antisemitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” Contemporary examples of antisemitism include: 1. Comparing Israel or Jews to the south african apartheid regime. 2.Questioning Israel\\'s legitimacy, history, existence or status as a nationstate. 3. Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews. 4. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. 5. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. 6. Denying the holocaust. 7. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust. 8. Accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide. 9. Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist, fake or an apartheid state. 10.Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation. 9. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel. 11. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis. 12. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.  You might encounter Tweets, that call out antisemitic behavior or other antisemitic tweets. They might cite antisemitic language, but are not in themselves antisemitic and should be classified as not antisemitic (0).  I will provide you with some examples for these kinds of tweets and suitable answers: Tweet 1: \"#BDS#supporters pervasive anti-Semitic rhetoric among boycott supporters that too often equates all things Israel and Jewish with the oppression of Palestinian rights.“ Answer 1: 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic rhetoric among BDS-Supporters. While criticizing said behavior, it cites antisemitic tropes, like blaming jews collectively for the politics of a nation state. But as it is critical toward these ideas, it is not in itself antisemitic. Tweet 2: \"Trump’s now saying saying AOC +3 are anti-Israel. Just fyi, his pet name for Kusher was ‘The Jew’ at ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ not a joke fyi. @realDonaldTrump\" Answer 2: 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic actions of Donald Trump and points out, that he is not in the position to criticize others politicians antisemitism. While it cites trumps antiseminitc remarks, the tweet is not antisemitic in of itself. Tweet 3: \"@andywartrol @Keir_Starmer @standardnews @JewishChron Oh I do love waking up in the morning and being called a \"zionazi\". Go join Galloways SWGB and leave us Jewish Labour members alone.\" Answer 3: 0. The author of the tweet complains about being called a \"zionazi\". While zionazi is an antisemitic term, it is in this case not used to attack or demonize jews, but to call out the antisemitism of others. The tweet is thereby not antisemitic.  You might also encounter tweets that accuse israel of being a apartheid state. These tweets should be classified as antisemitic. Here are some examples of tweets and suitable answers.  Tweet 1: @AOC Violence is voting for a bill that funds apartheid Israel, colonization of Palestine &amp; imperialism/coups in Latin America.\\t Answer 1: 1. This tweets can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between israel and the apartheid.  Tweet 2: @JewishChron ISRAEL IS A VILE APARTHEID STATE... Answer 2: 1 This tweets can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between israel and the apartheid. \\t You might also encounter tweets, that claim that israel is not a real state. These Tweets should be classified as antisemitic. Here are some examples:  Tweet 1: @TalHeinrich @AmbassadorRice @Slate Israel? Does not exist as country.\\t Answer 1: 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it claims Israel is not a real and valid nation state.   Tweet 2: @TalHeinrich @AmbassadorRice @Slate Israel? More like is fake.\\t Answer 2: 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it claims Israel is not a real and valid nation state.    <|im_end|> <|im_start|>user Now I want you to tell me, if the following tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. Please answer 1 if it is and 0 if it\\'s not and briefly explain your reasoning. This is the tweet I want you to take a look at: '"

      "Row 0: [0]  0. This tweet shares a quote from the Bible (specifically Psalm 136) and uses it as an example of poetry. While there are no explicit antisemitic elements present in this tweet, it is not expressing hatred or rhetorical manifestations against Jews or Israel, which would be required for classification as antisemitic according to the provided definition. The quote is a positive reference to Israel within the context of faith and religion.\n",
      "Row 1: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it contains a false accusation that Israel is stealing land and invading another country (Palestine). While Palestine is indeed in conflict with Israel, this statement oversimplifies and distorts the complex historical background of this issue. Moreover, comparing Israel's actions to Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland inserts an antisemitic undertone into the tweet. This kind of rhetoric often seeks to blame Jews for wrongdoing committed by a nation state or group, which falls under the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or rhetoric, but rather criticizes the misuse of the term \"antisemitic\" by some individuals who unjustly prevent criticism of the Israeli government. The author emphasizes that it is not antisemitic to challenge the government's actions and argues against those using the term \"antisemitic\" frivolously. Although the context involves Israel, the focus on freedom of expression and accurate use of terms makes this tweet not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3: [0]  0. This tweet does not appear to contain any antisemitic language or messaging. It references Israel's Gym in the context of the game Pokémon Go, which is not a platform for expressing hate towards Jewish people or promoting antisemitic ideas. The content of this tweet is neutral and doesn't fall under the definition of antisemitism as outlined above.\n",
      "Row 4: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly contain any antisemitic tropes or language and focuses on criticizing Iran's actions, specifically their funding of terror against both the United States and Israel. It also questions the Obama and Biden administrations' dealings with Iran. However, while it is critical of Iran, it is not targeting or demonizing Jewish individuals or Israel as a collective. The tweet's intent appears to be informational rather than antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 5: [0] 0. The tweet mentions \"bibi\" which seems to refer to Benjamin Netanyahu, a former Prime Minister of Israel. While the reference to Bibi can be seen as politically divisive, it does not contain any antisemitic tropes or stereotypes commonly associated with antisemitism. Furthermore, the use of \"viva bib am israel hai\" can be seen as expressing support for Israel and its people rather than harboring animosity towards Jews. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 6: [0]  0. This tweet criticizes Israel for its association with allegedly \"repressive and totalitarian\" regimes, without blaming Jews or the Jewish people as a whole. It does not use stereotypical allegations, dehumanizing language, nor make any claims about the legitimacy of Israel's existence as a nation-state. While some may interpret this tweet as implying negativity toward Israel, it is critical to remember that criticism of Israel's policies or actions alone does not necessarily equate to antisemitism.\n",

      "Row 77: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes, nor does it express hatred towards Jews. It refers to \"OT heathen kings that God used for the good of Israel,\" which could be interpreted as a reference to the Old Testament. The author appears to be discussing the possibility of change and drawing from religious contexts, without targeting or demonizing any Jewish individuals or institutions. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 78: [1]  0. Although the tweet criticizes Israel and uses strong language, it does not fit directly into any of the clear definitions of antisemitism provided in the guidelines. While it might be seen as inflammatory or provocative, it is more a critique of Israeli policy than an attack on Jewish people generally or Jews as a group. It can be considered that this tweet calls for the end of oppression and not specifically targeting Jews or Judaism. Therefore, according to the definition provided, it would be classified as not antisemitic (0). However, it is also important to remember that this classification may differ depending on additional contextual information outside these twelve examples of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 79: [0] 0. Although this tweet might express disagreement with Israel's policies towards Gaza, it does not employ antisemitic tropes or demonize Jews or the Jewish state as a whole.

      "Row 81: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or target them with hateful rhetoric or demonizing stereotypes. Rather, it points out what the author perceives as hypocrisy in addressing anti-Semitism by calling out alleged bias against Jews from Israel while simultaneously criticizing a specific group of Jewish people there (Mizrahim) who are immigrants from Muslim countries. The tweet does not accuse all Jews or Israelis of being collectively responsible for any wrongdoing, nor is it making blanket accusations that could be considered antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 82: [1]  This tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1). Although it does not directly mention Jews or Jewish people, it associates Israel with various negative attributes. These include war, racism, apartheid, surveillance, division, brutality, propaganda, lies, arrogance, disrespect, abuse, arms sales, drones, ultra-right-wing politics, land theft, steel barriers and walls. Such a comprehensive list of negative attributes often constitutes antisemitic discourse when applied to Israel specifically, especially given that Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people. While not every one of these points alone could be considered unequivocally antisemitic, their accumulation in this tweet does support an overall narrative that casts Israel and its Jewish citizens in a negative light. This can easily reinforce and contribute to existing stereotypes or biases against Jews and Israel.\n",
      "Row 83: [0]  0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or Israel with any of the examples mentioned in the definition of antisemitism. It compares hate speech from different countries including the United States, China, and Russia to that of Israel and mentions a specific individual named David Duke. However, it is not making any direct claims about Jews collectively, nor does it target Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities with hatred or antisemitic tropes.

      "Row 89: [0]  Based on the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet appears to be more focused on criticizing the actions of the Israeli government rather than targeting Jews as a group. While it does mention \"liberal zionists,\" it does not accuse all Jewish people or Israel as a nation of land theft. Therefore, I would classify this tweet as 0 (not antisemitic). The author is expressing frustration with the actions of a political entity and its supporters rather than demonizing an entire group of individuals.\n",
      "Row 90: [1] 1. This tweet claims that Israel does not exist as a country, which is an example of denying Jewish people's right to self-determination and questioning the legitimacy, history, existence or status of Israel.

The definition of antisemitism given emphasizes rhetoric or physical manifestations directed towards Jewish individuals, institutions, and religious facilities, or targeted against the State of Israel as a collective entity. This tweet simply shares a Bible verse without engaging in such behavior, making it not antisemitic.\n",

In this case, the author is advocating for the destruction of Israel by any means necessary, which can be seen as incitement to violence against Jewish people and the state of Israel. This constitutes an aggressive form of antisemitism because it targets both individuals and their property, as well as targeting community institutions and religious facilities associated with Judaism and Israel.

It acknowledges that being pro-Israel doesn't necessarily mean a person is anti-Semitic and expresses an observation about people's behavior when they find out the author is pagan.

      "Row 365: [1] 1. The tweet is critical towards Israel, particularly regarding its actions in relation to the Palestinians and the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. It may express a political opinion or dissatisfaction with certain Israeli policies, which could be subjective but does not necessarily equate to antisemitism. However, it does make a direct claim that Israel is an \"apartheid regime.\" In this context, the word \"apartheid\" is used to describe a system of oppression and discrimination rather than to target Jews or Judaism specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the term \"apartheid\" could be argued as a form of hyperbole, it's essential to remember that modern apartheid refers to a regime characterized by institutionalized racial inequality and systematic oppression.

This tweet does not contain any language that demonstrates a certain perception of Jews as hatred towards them nor does it target Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, institutions, religious facilities, or the state of Israel with rhetorical or physical manifestations of antisemitism.

Although some may view these examples as negative portrayals of the Israeli government, the content of the tweet itself does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided, thus making it not an example of antisemitic sentiment. The fact that this user is providing multiple instances of alleged actions by Israel suggests a critical perspective on those events, which may or may not be accurate or fair, but does not inherently constitute as expressions of hatred towards Jews or antisemitism.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. It implies that the removal of terrorist watchlists such as Sudan is due to acknowledging the \"Jew state\" (Israel), suggesting that the United States' actions are motivated by Jewish interests rather than geopolitical considerations or diplomacy.

      "3. Finally, the reference to Iran \"may survive if Trump/Kushner don't attack with 2 weeks\" could be interpreted as a reference to conspiracy theories surrounding Jared Kushner (who is Jewish) and his alleged ties to Iran.

      "Row 405: [0]  0. While this tweet does mention \"Israel\" and \"Jews,\" it is not expressing hatred toward Jews or targeting them with antisemitic tropes. The user corrects a misunderstanding about the racial identity of Jews. This statement does not fall under any of the 12 examples of antisemitism according to the provided definition, so it should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 406: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any of the specified antisemitic tropes or language as defined by our guidelines. It is discussing a political event (the JCPOA) and its impact on Iranian-Israeli relations, rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or using dehumanizing stereotypes about Jews or Israel. The tweet may contain criticism of Israel's role in the cancellation of the deal, but it does not exceed the threshold for being considered antisemitic according to our definition.\n",
      "Row 407: [0]  0. This tweet simply reports news about the vaccination process in Israel and some information about the aftermath of a few vaccinations, including that three deaths are unrelated to the vaccine. It does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes as per the definition provided. The tweet is not criticizing Jewish people collectively or making any negative generalizations about Jews or the state of Israel. The focus of the tweet is on the vaccination process and its effects, so it can be classified as non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 408: [0]  Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this particular tweet does not directly contain antisemitic content. The tweet is asking a question about the recipient's stance on ceasing financial support for Israel without making any accusations or statements about Jewish people collectively or expressing hatred toward Jews. Therefore, the answer for this specific case would be: 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 409: [0] 0. The tweet references Israel Folau, an Australian rugby union player and it suggests that the user is seeking a critique or a satirical comment about him in order to provide a break from intense discussions. There's no evidence of hatred towards Jews, accusations against Jewish people, or any manifestation of antisemitic tropes. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the definition of an antisemitic message and hence it is categorized as 0 (not-antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 410: [0] 0. While this tweet does not directly contain antisemitic rhetoric, it is focused on individual people (Jared Kushner and the Trump clan) rather than generalizing about Jews or Israel. The language used in this case is criticism of specific individuals rather than expressing hatred toward Jews or engaging in stereotypical allegations. Therefore, according to the given definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 411: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or prejudice towards Jews but instead criticizes another user for singling out Israel and ignoring the Palestinian Authority's (PA) statements about refusing Israeli aid during a pandemic. It also argues that Arabs are \"invaders\" and that Jews are indigenous to the region, which can be seen as a defense of Jewish people in this context. While there is a mention of the term \"Jewhateful Liar,\" it seems more focused on criticizing the user's bias towards Israel rather than expressing any antisemitic sentiments.\n",
      "Row 412: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic elements, as it critiques Israel's government policies without resorting to tropes or stereotypes commonly associated with antisemitism. The author of the tweet is questioning why Israel is leading in vaccination levels but isn't providing the vaccine to its Palestinian citizens. While this could potentially be a critique against Israeli policy, it does not exhibit the common hallmarks of antisemitism as defined within your parameters.\n",
      "Row 413: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition because it mentions Israel in a context where it is compared to Australia as another example, rather than expressing hatred toward Jews or using antisemitic tropes. The tweet does not contain any of the examples mentioned under the definition of antisemitism such as blaming all Jews for the actions of a nation state, equating all things Israel and Jewish with the oppression of Palestinian rights, or making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. The tweet is merely discussing the idea that the UK could close its borders completely like Australia and Israel have done in some cases.\n",
      "Row 414: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it does not contain any of the elements specified in the definition of antisemitism provided. It expresses excitement and support for a television show (\"#ErkenciKuş\") from Israel, along with positive reactions to it (e.g., \"Bravo! 👏👏👌👍\"). While Israel is mentioned, there is no expression of hatred or discrimination towards Jews or Jewish individuals. Instead, the tweet celebrates a piece of entertainment produced by a country, which does not inherently imply negative intentions toward any particular ethnic group.\n",
      "Row 415: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition because it does not contain any of the key elements or tropes that define antisemitism such as blaming Jews collectively, dehumanizing or demonizing them, accusing them of dual loyalty, etc. The user is criticizing a specific event committed by Israeli soldiers and urging for action against these alleged crimes. While it does mention Israel, the focus is on holding the country accountable for an alleged act of violence, rather than targeting Jews as a whole or promoting antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 416: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language, nor does it express hatred or target any individuals or institutions related to Judaism or Israel. It only discusses a policy matter between the United States and Israel regarding universal healthcare, suggesting that American citizens should migrate to Israel to access it. While there is some controversy surrounding this subject, the tweet itself does not fit into the definition of antisemitic behavior as described in the provided guidelines.\n",
      "Row 417: [0] 0. This tweet compares the number of vaccinations in different countries, including the United States, Israel, and Australia. It does not contain any antisemitic tropes or expressions of hatred toward Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions specifically.

      "Row 418: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic content or tropes. The author is proposing that Israel should provide asylum to refugees, which is a political opinion rather than an expression of hatred toward Jews or antisemitic sentiment. While the conversation might be about Israel, it does not target Jewish individuals, institutions, or religion with hate or demonization. Therefore, this tweet can be considered non-antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 419: [0] 1. This tweet contains expressions of hatred towards Jews, specifically targeting an individual Jew (Gal Gadot) and expressing disdain for Israel. While not explicitly mentioning \"Jews\" or using direct antisemitic tropes, the sentiment expressed is hateful towards a Jewish person and her country, which can be seen as an attempt to harm or demonize Jews collectively. Thus, it meets some of the criteria mentioned in the definition and can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 420: [1]  1. The tweet claims that Israel is \"an illegitimate terrorist state,\" which denies the legitimacy and existence of a nation state, according to criteria 2 and 9 in the provided definition of antisemitism. Although the tweet does not mention Jews specifically, its accusations of terrorism and illegitimacy are often directed toward Jewish people collectively when talking about Israel. Thus, it can be considered as an indirect attack on Jewish people, making the tweet fall under antisemitic content (1).\n",
      "Row 421: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic rhetoric or language according to the provided definition. It is simply commenting on the vaccination process in Israel and expressing admiration for their efforts without mentioning any negative sentiment towards Jewish individuals or institutions. Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 422: [1] 1. The tweet you've presented contains several elements that can be associated with antisemitism according to the definition provided. Specifically, it involves a conspiracy theory that attributes significant negative actions - such as the murder of JFK and Bobby Kennedy - to the Mossad (the intelligence agency of Israel) and Israel. This conspiratorial attribution, especially when applied in a harmful manner, can be a form of antisemitism because it seeks to blame the Jewish people for problems or misfortunes, even if they do not exist within a direct historical context. It's also worth noting that JFK was portrayed as having a negative stance towards Israel, specifically in relation to nuclear weapons and FARA. This could imply a negative generalization about Jews or Jewish actions - another characteristic of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, while the tweet contains elements indicative of antisemitic sentiment, it's crucial to recognize the distinction between criticizing political actions and policies of a government (which can be acceptable) versus attributing those actions to an entire group of people based on their religious or ethnic background (which is where we can enter into problematic territory). In this case, the tweet does seem to cross that line by accusing Mossad - an agency of Israel's government, not its Jewish citizens - and Israel as a whole. Therefore, according to your criteria, I would classify this particular tweet as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 423: [0] 0: This tweet does not appear to express hatred toward Jews or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions. It references Israel in a comparative context and calls for Canada to adopt \"Israel's lessons learned.\" While some might argue that discussing Israel's actions can lead to antisemitism, this particular message is not targeting Jewish people or demonizing them; rather, it is critiquing the political handling of issues by comparing to a nation-state and advocating for Canada to adopt a wise approach. This message does not contain elements of hatred or demonization as outlined in the definition of antisemitism provided. Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 424: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it does not contain any stereotypical allegations or demonizing statements towards Jews or Israel. It rather discusses a potential agreement between nations and their missile programs without targeting any specific group of people based on their religion or ethnicity.\n",
      "Row 425: [0]  0. This tweet does not explicitly reference or target Jews or Jewish people and focuses on comparing vaccination rates between different countries rather than making antisemitic assertions about Jews or the nation of Israel. While it mentions Israel among other nations, the statement is not rooted in stereotypical, dehumanizing, or demonizing allegations about Jews or their role in global affairs. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria to be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 426: [0]  Answer: 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The tweet expresses a critical view of Christian Zionism, stating it can be dangerous due to the disconnect between the financial support provided by Christian Zionists and their lack of knowledge about Jewish people. While the tweet touches upon Israel's existence and relationship with Christian Zionists, it does not employ antisemitic tropes or blame Jews collectively for issues related to Israel or other nations. It focuses on the actions and beliefs of Christian Zionists rather than on generalizing or dehumanizing Jewish people, therefore, it can be considered non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 427: [0]  This tweet does not directly use antisemitic language or tropes and mainly discusses Israeli actions toward Palestinians, which can be a legitimate subject of criticism. It is essential to distinguish between criticizing the actions of a state and the collective demonization of an ethnic group. In this case, although it highlights issues regarding Palestine, it does not target Jews collectively or engage in other forms of antisemitic behavior mentioned in the definition provided. Therefore, my answer would be 0 (not antisemitic).\n",

      "However, if the context and intention of the tweet are questionable or promote antisemitism through implication, it may require further analysis or additional information to make a proper judgment.\n",
      "Row 428: [0] 0. While this tweet does mention Israel, it does not contain any of the defining characteristics or examples of antisemitism listed in your definition. It simply makes a statement about an activity that could be done in Israel without any hateful or dehumanizing language towards Jews or Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 429: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It expresses a positive sentiment towards Israel and President Trump, who has been supportive of Israel's interests. While it could be argued that this kind of support might be seen as controversial by some, it does not include any negative rhetoric or stereotyping that is characteristic of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 430: [0] 0. This tweet calls out institutional Islamophobia, anti-semitism, and racism within the Tory party. Although it highlights a disparity in Muslim and Jewish populations in the UK, it does not demonize or target Jews as a collective. Rather, it criticizes the Tory party's lack of action against these issues while accusing the Labour party of being smeared for isolated cases. The tweet is critical toward the Tory party and sheds light on their actions (or lack thereof) regarding Islamophobia and anti-semitism, rather than expressing antisemitic views itself. Therefore, according to the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 431: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals, institutions, religious facilities, or the state of Israel with manifestations of antisemitism as defined. The reference to Pilate asking Jesus if he was a king of the Jews is a historical and religious event within Christianity. It is not a contemporary example of demonizing, stereotyping, dehumanizing, or questioning Jewish existence, legitimacy, or rights, nor does it call for violence or discrimination against Jews or Israelis. Hence, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 432: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition you provided, as it does not exhibit any of the mentioned characteristics that would be considered hateful or discriminatory towards Jewish individuals or Israel. Instead, this tweet refutes Trump's claim about the Democratic Party being an \"Anti-Jewish Party\" by providing statistical evidence demonstrating a larger number of Jewish Democrats in Congress compared to Jewish Republicans. Additionally, it brings up the topic of Jexodus, which is mentioned alongside the Trump administration, but does not engage in any hateful language or stereotypes towards Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 433: [0]  0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them specifically; it points out the arrest of a Nazi supporter, who intended to harm various groups, including Hispanics and Blacks. The focus is on the actions of the individual and their connections to Trump supporters rather than attacking Jewish people as a collective. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 434: [0] 0. The given tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes, but rather expresses a desire for free prescriptions. Though it references \"Jews,\" it is not targeting Jews with hatred or blame. Instead, the individual appears to be using the term \"Jews\" as an example of a group that has been historically known to advocate for access to free prescriptions. Therefore, it does not fit into any of the categories outlined in the provided definition of antisemitism and should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 435: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit clear antisemitic language or intent according to the provided definition of antisemitism. The tweet appears to be making a joke about Arab and Jihadi supporters being confused, rather than demonizing Jews or Israel. While it may not be tasteful humor, it does not fit the criteria for being classified as antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 436: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target any individual or group with dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. Instead, it is critical of Trump's actions and his questioning of some Jewish Americans' loyalty to Israel. While it cites the religious affiliation of Trump's daughter and son-in-law, the tweet does not target or blame them for any issue. Hence, it is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 437: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism, as it does not target Jews or Israel with hatred, nor does it express any of the listed examples of contemporary manifestations of antisemitism. It rather addresses broader historical and legal issues, comparing legal systems and their failures to uphold morality during the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation periods. The tweet is not attacking Jews or Israeli policies, but criticizes the failure of law enforcement in those instances to support moral values.\n",
      "Row 438: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language, and it is criticizing someone else's actions and prioritization. It points out Glyn Secker's past statements as problematic but does not make further claims against Jews or Israel. Therefore, the tweet itself is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 439: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic based on the provided definition and examples of antisemitism. The text of the tweet promotes numerous antisemitic tropes, such as Jews controlling major industries, being responsible for the death of millions during World War II, and using their influence to finance terrorism around the world. These ideas perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews and promote prejudice and discrimination against them.\n",
      "Row 440: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic for multiple reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It invokes the historical trauma of the Holocaust, which targeted six million Jewish people and subjected them to unimaginable atrocities. Invoking this event in a flippant or rhetorical manner, especially as a joke or taunt, can be deeply upsetting to the Jewish community.\n",
      "2. It implies that Jews have some sort of connection to concentration camps or that they \"clawed their way into\" one. This stereotype is a harmful distortion of reality and perpetuates the antisemitic myth of Jews being responsible for their own persecution during the Holocaust, a lie that was propagated by the Nazis themselves.\n",
      "3. It is also noteworthy that the tweet does not have any other purpose or context than to make a joke about the concentration camps. This demonstrates a lack of empathy and understanding for the suffering that the Jewish people endured during this time, further contributing to an antisemitic sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, according to our given definition, this tweet is classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 441: [0] 0. The tweet highlights possible inaccuracies in a poll regarding British Jews' opinions on Corbyn and potential emigration. While the language used may not be perfect, the content of the tweet is criticizing an inadequate sample size for the poll, rather than engaging in antisemitic rhetoric. Therefore, it can be considered as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 442: [0]  1. The use of the word \"hates\" in reference to an entire belief system implies a generalization and stereotype about people who practice Islamic philosophy, which may lead to negative associations with Jews and Christians. This falls under point 4 of your definition of antisemitism: \"Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.\" Although this tweet does not specifically target Jews but mentions them alongside Christians in a negative context, it is still contributing to a narrative that can be harmful and could lead to further antisemitic sentiments. Thus, this tweet should be classified as 1 - antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 443: [1] 1. The tweet contains generalizations and stereotypical allegations about Jewish individuals or the power of Jews collectively, which align with the definition of antisemitism provided. Therefore, I classify this tweet as antisemitic (1). It accuses Jews, without specifying a specific individual, of stealing from Black people. This is an example of holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of individuals or nations. The use of \"the ones that help\" also implies a conspiracy and demonization of Jewish people in the context of this tweet, further reinforcing its antisemitic nature.\n",
      "Row 444: [0] 0. According to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not fall under any of the points specified as antisemitic behaviors or manifestations. It plays on a common trope where people question someone's Jewish identity based on appearance, and it offers an ironic response to it rather than perpetuating stereotypes or hatred towards Jews or Judaism. The tweet is essentially challenging people to think about their assumptions regarding appearances and religious identities without promoting any of the antisemitic tropes listed in the guidelines.\n",
      "Row 445: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it refers to a Hitlerian slogan that incites violence against Jews and falsely attributes this slogan to the Palestinian Authority and its terrorist gangs, which serves to demonize Palestinians and perpetuate harmful stereotypes about them. The false attribution of this hateful message to an entire group (in this case, Palestinians) aligns with the definition of antisemitism, particularly in point 3: \"Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews.\" Additionally, it fits into point 10: \"Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation.\" This tweet accuses the Palestinian Authority and its terrorist gangs of promoting violence against Jews when it is likely referencing a real-world instance where antisemitic rhetoric or violence has occurred. However, by attributing this slogan to the Palestinians without evidence, it creates a false equivalence that is both antisemitic and damaging to the image of the Palestinian people.\n",
      "Row 446: [1] 0. While this tweet contains elements of disrespect and slight sarcasm, it does not specifically target Jews or make dehumanizing claims about them. It also doesn't call for harm towards any individual or group. Therefore, based on the definition you provided, it should not be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 447: [0] 0. This tweet does not use any antisemitic tropes or explicitly target Jews or the Jewish community. Instead, it makes a general statement about the historical context of legalized atrocities and highlights that legality is not an indicator of morality. The mention of the Holocaust in this context is to emphasize a larger societal point rather than singling out Jews for criticism or vilification.\n",
      "Row 448: [0]  0. This tweet does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided. It acknowledges an unfortunate reality faced by Jews in New York and criticizes those who may attempt to place blame on the victims, which is a counter-narrative to antisemitic attitudes. While it doesn't dismiss or downplay the antisemitism problem, it does not itself embody the ideological underpinnings of antisemitism according to our definition.\n",
      "Row 449: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it simply states that Jews are social and doesn't contain any rhetoric or language promoting hatred towards Jews, nor does it contain any of the other forms of antisemitism listed in the given definitions. The statement is neutral in its nature and does not demonize or dehumanize Jews.\n",
      "Row 450: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly contain antisemitic language or express hatred towards Jews or Judaism, but rather criticizes a specific individual for allegedly using accusations of antisemitism as a political tool. Although the context is centered around antisemitism and its impact on Jewish people worldwide, the tweet itself is not intrinsically antisemitic as it calls out an individual's actions towards trivilizing antisemitism rather than endorsing or promoting hatred or harm against Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 451: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it is expressing concern about the presence of antisemitism in society and criticizing a particular politician for exploiting the issue for personal gain rather than addressing the issue itself. While it does discuss the presence of antisemitism in society, the tweet itself does not promote or support any form of hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 452: [0]  Based on your definition, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1). My reasoning is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "This tweet compares the hatred of Jewish people from some Islamicists to the antisemitism seen in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. This comparison associates the targeted group (Jewish people) with an oppressive regime and its atrocities. The tweet also implies that some Islamicists advocate for a \"Final Solution,\" which refers to the Nazi policy of exterminating all Jews, further escalating the antisemitic nature of this statement.\n",
      "Row 453: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism, as it does not contain any elements that are explicitly targeting Jews or their property, Jewish institutions or religious facilities, or Israel. Although it mentions \"Jews\" in a historical context related to WW2, it is discussing whether innocent civilians were targeted by Jews during that time, rather than making dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective. The question posed in the tweet asks if Jews retaliated against random Germans during WW2, which does not imply hatred toward Jews but seeks to make a comparison with a specific scenario involving another group (Germans). As it is asking a question rather than spreading hate or false information about Jews, it should be classified as non-antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 454: [0] 0. The tweet does not explicitly make any antisemitic claims or rhetorical statements against the Jewish people or the state of Israel. It simply mentions \"Jews\" in a conversation context and doesn't contain any antisemitic tropes, nor is it accusing Jews or Israel of wrongdoing. Hence, according to the provided definition and examples of antisemitism, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 455: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. The author is highlighting that both the progressive left and alt-right are making similar accusations or claims about \"Dastardly Jews,\" which they seem to find ironic or absurd. While the term \"dastardly\" could be interpreted as slightly negative, it does not fall under the definition of antisemitism provided. The tweet itself is not promoting hatred towards Jews or using tropes to blame all Jews for certain actions, but rather highlighting hypocrisy and irony in political discourse.\n",
      "Row 456: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it associates a specific political group (the left) with hatred towards Jews, which is a stereotype that falls under point #4 of the definition of antisemitism provided: \"Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.\" The tweet implies that those who identify as left-leaning are inherently anti-Semitic and hateful towards Jews, which perpetuates a negative stereotype without providing any context or evidence.\n",
      "Row 457: [0]  0. This tweet does not promote hatred or rhetoric towards Jews, and rather encourages American Jews to stand in solidarity with Rep. Ilhan Omar. While the context of the tweet touches on issues involving Israel and Rep. Omar's previous remarks that were criticized for their antisemitic connotation, the overall tone does not fall into the definition of antisemitism as it is defined and explained in the prompt. Instead, the author calls upon Jewish individuals to make a choice in light of the situation with Ilhan Omar, without vilifying Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 458: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it does not contain any of the defined elements of antisemitism such as accusations about Jews or Israel, stereotypical or dehumanizing allegations against Jews, or comparison between Israel and any form of oppression. The tweet references Sarah Sanders, who was then White House Press Secretary, evading a question regarding Trump's view on whether Democrats hate Jews. It does not demonize or blame Jewish people in general but rather highlights her avoidance to address the question.\n",
      "Row 459: [0]  Based on the definition provided, I would classify this tweet as 0. The tweet is not antisemitic in nature. It seems to refer to a specific Jewish practice (muktzah) and mentions a rabbinical figure (the Shach), but does not involve any hatred or expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment, nor does it target the state of Israel or its institutions. The content of this tweet is discussing a specific aspect of Jewish religious practices and tradition, which may be of interest to those who are knowledgeable about these matters, and can be seen as part of an ongoing cultural dialogue within the Jewish community rather than something that could be construed as anti-Semitic.\n",
      "Row 460: [0] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic in itself, as it critiques the perceived actions of a future Israeli government and its potential impact on American Jews. Although the term \"antisemitism\" is used in the context of Israel's possible future action, it does not demonize or dehumanize Jewish people collectively or spread hatred towards them. The tweet calls attention to the hypothetical consequences of a particular political shift within the Israeli government and its potential to impact relations between American Jews and Israel rather than perpetuating antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 461: [0] 0. The tweet does not express any hatred towards Jews or use demonizing or stereotypical allegations about them.

      "Row 462: [0] 0. The provided tweet does not explicitly show any elements of antisemitism, as defined by the given text. It refers to \"a jews for Jesus vibe\", which is a reference to a religious group called Jews For Jesus, and not directed towards Jews or Judaism with hate, but rather, it's an expression of disapproval of something that seems incompatible, similar to how some may feel about a specific political affiliation. The tweet does not exhibit any of the ten criteria provided as examples of antisemitic behavior, such as blaming Jews for \"why things go wrong,\" denying Jewish self-determination, or accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. Thus it is not considered to be antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 464: [0] 0. While the tweet references an \"antisemitic stereotype,\" it is not expressing hatred or targeting Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it appears to be a critical remark on another user's statement involving two users (@RosieDuffield1 and @mikekatz) which seems unrelated to the definition of antisemitism provided. The tweet itself does not endorse nor support hatred towards Jews or their properties, so it should not be classified as an instance of antisemitic behavior.\n",
      "Row 465: [0] 1. This tweet is clearly antisemitic based on our definition. The phrase \"O Jews keng\" is a direct reference to the antisemitic stereotype that Jewish people are responsible for financial exploitation, often associated with greed or profiteering during World War II and other crises. The user's intention here is to use this negative stereotype against the individual they are addressing in a derogatory way. This tweet meets several of our definition points: \n",
      "1. Dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective.\n",
      "2. Accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide.\n",

The tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes, nor does it target Jews or Jewish community institutions and religious facilities with hatred, rhetorical manifestations, or physical violence.

This tweet is antisemitic for several reasons: It refers to Jews as \"Talmudic Jews,\" which can be perceived as dehumanizing and stereotypical, implying that all Jews adhere to the Talmud in a certain way (which is not accurate). Moreover, it further perpetuates division and confusion by suggesting that antisemites might selectively choose who they consider \"Talmudic Jews\" based on their convenience.

      "Row 475: [1]  1. This tweet, which cites a verse from the Quran about people attributing divine qualities to others besides God, can be seen as antisemitic if taken in isolation and without further context.

      "3. In the context of modern anti-semitism, this verse is often cited as an antisemitic slur because it implies that the Jewish people commit a similar sin to those who disbelieved before them (specifically mentioned in the Quran are Christians and Jews).

The tweet does not use any antisemitic tropes or make any accusations against Jews or Israel. Instead, it highlights the importance of remembering the history of antisemitism and the struggles faced by Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 601: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes an article published by the Jewish Chronicle for allegedly denying the right of Muslims to fear hatred against themselves, while also expressing sympathy towards the fears of the Jewish community. While it may contain a critique of another publication's perceived unfairness in its coverage or lack of empathy, it does not express antisemitic sentiments nor target Jews with hatred. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to this definition.\n",
      "Row 602: [0] 1. The tweet contains a comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime, which is mentioned as antisemitic in the provided definition of antisemitism. Therefore, based on that comparison, it can be considered as containing antisemitic elements. This does not mean the person who posted the tweet is necessarily antisemitic, but the content of the message itself can be classified as potentially contributing to an atmosphere of prejudice against Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 603: [0] 0. The provided tweet does not exhibit any of the characteristics mentioned in the definition of antisemitism. It shows concern for both Christians and Jews facing violence, expressing empathy rather than hate or prejudice against either group. Thus, it is not classified as an instance of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 604: [0]  0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or promote any kind of harm, demonization, or stereotyping. Rather, it highlights that conflating support for the state of Israel with the support for Jewish people is inaccurate and can be considered anti-Semitic when used to justify harmful actions or ideas against either group. It does not contain any antisemitic tropes or content itself.\n",
      "Row 605: [0]  Answer: 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: This tweet does not promote or endorse antisemitic ideologies but rather criticizes the comparison of Omar to 9/11, stating that \"Jews killed Jesus\" phrase has been used to subjugate Jewish people for centuries. The tweet calls out the double-standard of drawing equivalences between these two phrases and highlights how such comparisons are bigoted. This critique does not fit any of the definitions of antisemitism outlined earlier, making it a non-antisemitic statement (0).\n",
      "Row 606: [0] 0: This tweet does not contain any of the key elements of antisemitism as defined in the context given. The user is expressing their personal opinion about an incident involving \"Jews For Jesus,\" specifically their disapproval regarding a campaign or event they found in poor taste, rather than displaying any malevolent sentiment towards Jews or Israel as a whole. While it's possible to interpret this negatively and assume that the person may hold negative views towards all Jewish individuals or organizations (which would be an antisemitic act), the tweet itself does not present any explicit expressions of hatred, dehumanization, demonization, or targeting of Jews or Israel, as per the definition provided. It is important to consider context and individual intent when evaluating these kinds of statements for antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 607: [0] 0. The given tweet does not express any hatred towards Jews or make dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. It is criticizing the Israeli government's decision to release the videos of Islamist terrorists murdering Jews and addressing the potential consequences for those who watch it. Although the content discussed in the tweet involves violence against Jews, it does not target Jews as a collective nor does it express any antisemitic views or sentiment.\n",
      "Row 608: [0]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it cites the President making disparaging remarks about Jews. The content of this tweet is critical towards a political leader, who in this case, has targeted Jews with hateful language. Although it does not contain explicit accusations or comparisons to the Holocaust, apartheid, or other tropes commonly found in antisemitic rhetoric, the fact that it quotes the President making such remarks about an entire group of people on a protected basis is a form of hate speech and therefore falls under this definition of antisemitism. The classification here is based on the principle of attributing hateful sentiments to a prominent political figure, even if those are not their actual words. This can be seen as a form of endorsement or normalization of such sentiments by association with a leader's office, which in this case is antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 609: [0] 0. While this tweet mentions \"Antisemitism\" and compares it to another issue, its main intention is not to express hatred towards Jews or promote antisemitic ideas. Instead, the user seems to be sarcastically stating that both situations (antisemitism in the Labour Party and violent racists in BNP) should be ignored by their respective targeted groups before voting for either party, suggesting that they are equally problematic. While the mention of \"Antisemitism\" is present, it doesn't promote or spread antisemitic ideas, but rather highlights the issue within both parties.\n",
      "Row 610: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements of antisemitism according to the provided definition. The author stereotypes Jews as \"god's chosen people\" and implies that they are superior to others, which is a form of dehumanizing allegations. Furthermore, it claims that Jews exploit others due to their belief in themselves being chosen by god. This demonstrates a generalized prejudice against Jewish individuals or groups, making the tweet antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 611: [0] 1. The tweet contains hateful and dehumanizing language directed toward Ilhan Omar, implying that she dislikes not only \"America\" and \"Americans\", but also \"Jews\". The use of the words \"bitch\" and \"terrorist\" demonstrate a clear intent to harm and demonize. Furthermore, it aligns with several elements mentioned in your list such as dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews (1). The tweet also fits under the broader category of targeting individuals (in this case, Ilhan Omar) based on their perceived identity or beliefs, which includes, but is not limited to, being Jewish. Therefore, according to the provided definition and examples, the tweet appears antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 612: [0]  0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews, nor is it making any demonizing or stereotypical allegations about them. Instead, it appears to critique certain individuals within a political group and calls out the potential for antisemitic sentiment among these people. While it cites antisemitism as a negative characteristic, it does not endorse this viewpoint itself, thus not being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 613: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any of the characteristics defined as antisemitic in the given definition. It's a call for the British Conservative party to address an issue, and it's signed \"Yours sincerely, British Jews!\". Although it's informal in tone, it doesn't accuse all Jewish people or Israel of anything, nor does it use antisemitic tropes or stereotypes. It is therefore not classified as antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 614: [0] 1: The tweet is referencing Boris Johnson's involvement in an antisemitic scandal by pointing out that he depicted Jews as controlling the media and being able to \"fiddle\" elections in a novel from 2004 when he was a Tory MP. This statement, if true, falls under the definition of antisemitism as it charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, which is one of the listed examples of antisemitic behavior in your provided list. Furthermore, the mention of \"fiddling\" elections is an antisemitic trope that has historically been used against Jewish people. Even though the tweet does not contain explicit hate speech, it does bring up historical antisemitism, which makes this tweet an appropriate candidate for a classification of 1: antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 615: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. It does not express hatred toward Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions. The user is sharing an experience they had in Iran regarding Jews feeling safe there and questions their own emotions about that situation, but does not express any of the 10 points mentioned as criteria for antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 616: [0]  1. The tweet references a historical comparison between the Nazis' treatment of Jews and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's statements or beliefs regarding Jews, which implies that she may hold antisemitic views. This kind of association with historical atrocities against Jews is a common antisemitic tactic employed to demonize Jews or individuals perceived as Jewish, and therefore, it can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 617: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the definition provided. It is addressing a specific individual (Kirchik) and discussing a hypothetical alliance between heterosexual Jewish people and gay non-Jews. The reference to \"kick Kirchik out of both clubs\" could potentially be interpreted as an attempt at humor rather than hatred or criticism of Jews or Judaism. However, without more context, it is difficult to definitively say this tweet is not antisemitic. But based on the information provided and given that it does not target Jews collectively nor use dehumanizing tropes, the tweet can be classified as non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 618: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism; instead, it highlights a situation involving racist abuse directed at British Jews by a group of UK Labour supporters. The author expresses their concern over the issue and points out an inconsistency in how racism against other minority groups is treated compared to that of Jews. This tweet criticizes the unfair treatment of Jewish people rather than perpetuating hate or bigotry towards them, which makes it not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 619: [0] 1. The given tweet contains antisemitic content. It references the historical Holocaust by invoking an analogy with Hitler seeking out Jews, which is a known antisemitic trope. Additionally, it criticizes politicians and Congress as if they are acting like Jews, which can be seen as demonizing or dehumanizing Jews in the political context. Although this tweet critiques Trump, it does so through an antisemitic lens. This makes the tweet itself antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 620: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or expressions and instead asks the user if they are equating Jews with Israel, which is a common concern when it comes to discussions about Israel and its actions. The focus of this tweet is on clarifying the intent behind another's statement rather than demonizing or targeting Jewish people. Therefore, according to the given definition, the tweet can be classified as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 621: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, because it does not exhibit any of the characteristics that constitute antisemitism as outlined in the guidelines you've shared with me. The tweet instead appears to be discussing internalized oppression and colonization within the context of the Jewish community itself. While the content may be seen by some as critical or even negative, it does not meet the definition of antisemitic expression, which often targets Jews collectively, denies their rights (such as self-determination), or employs harmful stereotypes and tropes against them.\n",
      "Row 622: [0] 0. While the tweet does express negative opinions about Ilhan Omar, it is not antisemitic according to the definition provided because it doesn't contain any rhetoric or tropes specifically targeting Jews or Jewish people. The claim that she \"hates Jews\" is a personal accusation against her as an individual and should be judged within that context. Additionally, while calling her a \"racist\" could have antisemitic implications if it were referring to her beliefs about Jews, the tweet does not specify that this accusation of racism refers to antisemitism or any issues related to Jewish people. It is also important to note that the tweet does not target or demonize all Jewish individuals or institutions, nor does it imply a conspiracy involving Jews. The focus is on criticizing Ilhan Omar and her alleged behavior, rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or using tropes about Jews.\n",
      "Row 623: [0] 1. The tweet contains several points which may be indicative of antisemitism: it includes \"Hate for Jews\" alongside other targets (Tories, Israel), and expresses a specific preference towards countries like Venezuela, Russia, Iran & Palestine that have a history of anti-Israel and, in some cases, antisemitic policies. These elements alone may not be enough to classify the tweet as purely antisemitic; however, they do suggest an underlying sentiment that could contribute to an environment of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to assess whether a specific tweet is antisemitic according to our definition, we also need to consider the broader context in which it's written and the intentions of the author. In this case, since only one tweet is provided, we can only examine the content of that individual message.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, this tweet appears to be expressing a general disdain for various entities and groups. The phrase \"Hate for Jews\" does indicate a negative sentiment towards Jewish people; however, it is not accompanied by any rhetoric that seeks to demonize or dehumanize them specifically (such as accusations of conspiracy, blood libel, or collectively holding Jews responsible for the actions of Israel).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the tweet acknowledges hatred for multiple entities and expresses a preference for others. While this may not be a strong endorsement of antisemitic ideologies, it does contribute to a broader context in which antisemitism can thrive – by equating negative emotions towards Jews with those towards other groups or countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, given the limited information available and the need for further contextual understanding, I would classify this tweet as potentially contributing to an environment of antisemitism but not necessarily embodying it in its purest form. Therefore, my answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 (Potentially Antisemitic)\n",
      "\n",
      "This classification implies that the tweet may contain elements that are conducive to or supportive of antisemitic attitudes, which could create an environment where more blatant forms of antisemitism can thrive. However, it does not contain explicit language or rhetoric that directly demonizes Jews or seeks to hold them responsible for all the aforementioned hatreds.\n",
      "Row 624: [0] 0. This tweet does not seem to be antisemitic according to the definition provided, although it references the historical context of Jewish people during a specific time period (likely referring to Nazi Germany). The main focus of this statement is on the argument against weapons confiscation affecting only small minorities and their difficulty in defending themselves. While it does mention Jews, it is not accusing them or making stereotypical allegations. It is simply stating a historical fact about a specific time period.\n",
      "Row 625: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism because it targets all Jewish people by urging the reader not to fear speaking out against them, which falls under the category of expressing hatred towards Jews. The statement also violates the principle of not generalizing or holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of individuals or groups related to Israel or otherwise, as stipulated in multiple categories of antisemitism (e.g., 3, 6, and 12).\n",
      "Row 626: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic, as it does not contain any of the elements mentioned in the definition of antisemitism. The user seems to be questioning if there are restrictions on Jewish individuals participating in the Brexit Party, but this tweet itself does not express hatred towards Jews or target them unfairly.\n",
      "Row 627: [0] 0. This tweet calls out the BBC for providing a platform to certain individuals who hold strong views about Muslims. While it is critical of those being given attention on the BBC, it does not use antisemitic tropes or target Jews in a negative way. The focus is on criticizing the BBC's choices regarding Islamophobic commentators and not on making antisemitic statements.\n",
      "Row 628: [0]  0. The tweet does not directly use any antisemitic tropes nor demonize or target Jews individually or collectively. Instead, it encourages caution when making statements about the cohesiveness of various ethnic groups and questions the comparison made in the initial tweet by @JohnJRotten. While the initial statement may touch upon stereotypical ideas associated with Jewish people, the second tweet is not inherently antisemitic, as it questions such stereotypes rather than perpetuating them.\n",
      "Row 629: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language, but rather defends Israel's right to self-defense and acknowledges its history of overcoming adversity. It supports the idea that Israel has a right to respond to attacks, and it highlights Israel's acceptance of openly gay people, which is an aspect that sets them apart from some other countries in the region. Although it mentions \"haters of Jews and Israel,\" it is not accusing the entire group of these individuals of antisemitic beliefs or actions. It is rather countering their claims with a factual response about Israel's positive aspects, so it does not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the definition you provided as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 630: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic rhetoric and rather highlights the hypocrisy between the reactions towards Nazis' actions against Jews and Jihadists' actions against Hindus, comparing it with today's world. While the comparison might be controversial or provocative, it is not inherently antisemitic by itself. The tweet emphasizes that denying the Holocaust and sympathizing with Nazis are punishable in many countries, while similar crimes committed by Jihadists receive less condemnation, which may call for a broader societal or political conversation rather than being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 631: [0] 0: This tweet does not directly or inherently express hatred toward Jews or Israel. It appears to be discussing the legality of the Holocaust rather than promoting antisemitic ideas or tropes. While the phrasing may seem shocking, it is not an attack on Jewish people but a commentary on the context in which the Holocaust took place. The intention here seems to emphasize that the morality and justification of actions should be evaluated separately from their legality, rather than targeting Jews or Israel specifically.\n",
      "Row 632: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition because it calls out the problem of antisemitism coming from \"all sides\" and criticizes an organization for ignoring that fact, implying that they are not being fair or complete in their coverage. It does not contain any rhetoric or stereotypes about Jews or Israel that would qualify as antisemitic under the given definition.\n",
      "Row 633: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes. Instead, it is encouraging Jews to hold their own accountable and stop those who may be inciting Islamophobia. It references a Jewish proverb from the Pirkei Avot as a call to action for personal responsibility within the community. Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet can be considered non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 634: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the number of discussions about Jews on Radio Four and makes a comparison with Protestants. While it does not directly attack or demonize Jews, it seems more critical of the disproportionate representation of Jewish topics on the radio rather than being antisemitic itself. It also expresses gratitude towards Protestants, which shows no indication of hostility towards Jews or any other group.\n",
      "Row 635: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the definition provided. The tweet is pointing out a perceived hypocrisy or misunderstanding by user @SolWpolski, suggesting that he jumps to conclusions about Jeremy Corbyn's intentions.

      "Row 638: [0]  0. This tweet does not seem to contain antisemitic content. The user mentions that \"as Jews\" they had to leave their previous location due to the fear of being lynched, which is a reference to historical instances of violence and persecution against Jewish communities in some places. The mention of \"Never again\" at the end could be understood as an allusion to the Holocaust and a commitment to prevent such tragic events from happening in the future.

      "\n",
      "The statement \"The Jews are not loyal to the state\" by Adolf Hitler is a direct example of accusing Jews collectively for their perceived disloyalty. This kind of sweeping generalization and collective attribution of loyalty or disloyalty is indeed a characteristic of antisemitic rhetoric.\n",

      "Additionally, the statement \"Any Jew that votes Democrat is disloyal\" by Donald Trump also bears elements of antisemitism because it makes an assumption about Jewish voters without factual evidence, and suggests that all Jews are not loyal if they vote for a certain political party.

      "Row 643: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or their property, Jewish community institutions, religious facilities, or the State of Israel in a manner that conforms to the definition of antisemitism provided.

      "Row 644: [0] 0. The tweet does not express hatred or harm towards Jewish individuals or the Jewish community, nor does it target any individual or institution with dehumanizing allegations or demonizing tropes.

      "Row 662: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any of the antisemitic tropes or behavior mentioned in the definition. It expresses confusion regarding some American Jews' opinions on Israel and supports the idea that every Jew should be pro-Israel. This stance is similar to the author's personal belief, as they converted to Judaism 30 years ago in Israel and consider themselves pro-Israel. The tweet does not contain any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. It only questions why some Jewish people do not support Israel.\n",
      "Row 663: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it commemorates Holocaust Memorial Day and honors the millions of Jews and other victims who were extinguished by the Nazi regime. The message promotes fighting hate and ensuring atrocities never happen again, which aligns with the values of combating bigotry and discrimination.\n",
      "Row 664: [0] 1. The tweet contains historical misinformation, as it falsely claims that Jews were exterminated during the Holocaust because of a supposed exchange for \"religious freedom\" made by Christians. This statement is not true and perpetuates an antisemitic trope. Furthermore, it implies that there is an inherent conflict between Jewish people and Christians. According to the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet can be considered antisemitic as it stereotypically portrays Jews and holds them collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel. It also blames Jews for real or imagined wrongdoing committed during a historical period.\n",

      "Row 667: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it equates a group of people (in this case, thieves) with another specific ethnic or religious group (\"The Jews\") and continues to refer to that same group later in the text using code words (which could potentially allude to Jewish individuals). The use of an obscenity and vulgarity to defame others, as mentioned in the tweet, further highlights a pattern of targeting perceived \"others\" with negative and dehumanizing language.

This type of conspiracy theory is one of the examples of antisemitism listed in the definition, specifically point 5: \"Accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.\" In this case, it's not just about Israel or its state policies but is targeting all Jewish people.

The tweet contains a series of antisemitic tropes, including comparing Israel to nomads and then to \"godless thieves and murderers\" followed by referring to Jews as \"parasitic profiteering zionists.\" These comparisons demonize and stereotype Jewish people, which are characteristics of antisemitism. Additionally, the mention of \"zionist\" can be considered an attack against Zionism, a political ideology that supports Israel's right to exist as a Jewish nation-state, often used to target Jews collectively.

However, it contains a stereotype about Jewish power and influence in ancient Rome, which could potentially be perceived as antisemitic.

This implies a belief in the stereotype of Jewish control over others throughout history, which is not explicitly antisemitic but can be perceived as perpetuating an antisemitic idea.

      "- The tweet mentions the \"Six Days War\" and implies that after the conflict, Jews gave the keys to Muslims without receiving reciprocity. This part of the tweet seems to promote a false narrative about the conflict, which can be seen as a form of dehumanizing or demonizing Jews and Muslims alike, but in this context, it particularly targets Jews.\n",
      "- The tweet also claims that \"Muslims invade Europe,\" which is an antisemitic trope used to blame Jews for problems occurring in other societies. This part of the tweet reinforces negative stereotypes about Muslim immigrants and promotes a divisive narrative against these groups, but it primarily targets Muslims by using them as a scapegoat.\n",
      "- The tweet ends with the statement that \"only contribution here and Israel, is violence & death.\" This line implies that only Jews (through their state of Israel) contribute to violence and death, which can be perceived as accusing Jews collectively for actions taken by a nation-state, even though it is not limited to Israeli policies.\n",

Instead, it compares the antichrist figure to historical and contemporary figures who have targeted various religious groups, including Jews (Adolf Hitler), Christians (ISIS, Al-Shaabab).

The tweet suggests that Jeremy Corbyn, a political figure who has been accused by some of having antisemitic associations, harbors hatred towards Jews.

This sort of blanket accusation can often be a precursor for more direct antisemitic actions or rhetoric. The idea that Jews can just be made to \"live in peace and respect\" while others live without restrictions is another form of blaming Jews for societal problems, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 853: [1] 1. The tweet contains a clear expression of hatred towards Jews, referring to them as \"evil jews.\" It also makes use of a conspiracy theory (Illuminati) that is often associated with antisemitic tropes. Additionally, it calls for a distinction between \"old\" and \"new\" Illuminati, which might be interpreted as an attempt to differentiate between Jews who have been blamed for various wrongdoings in the past and present, thus fueling anti-Jewish sentiment.\n",

      "Row 855: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic. It acknowledges that the majority of Jews worldwide agree with Israel and refutes the idea that support for Israel can automatically be considered as antisemitic.

By doing so, this tweet counters antisemitic notions and is therefore not antisemitic itself.\n",

      "\n",
      "Secondly, there's no evidence provided that backs up this claim regarding the need to \"lock up\" any group - let alone specifically targeting Jews over Christians.

Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 867: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language, and it highlights various forms of violence and persecution that Jewish communities have faced throughout history.

      "Row 870: [0]  0. The tweet does not contain any overtly antisemitic language, tropes, or ideas and is instead highlighting a hypocritical trend on social media where people who have only recently become aware of Louis Farrakhan's history of antisemitism are suddenly lecturing Jews about antisemitism. This critique may be based on the fact that some of these individuals might ignore or downplay Farrakhan's antisemitic statements and actions when he was more active, or when it served their interests, only to denounce him once his views become popular on social media. By doing so, this tweet does not endorse, spread, or normalize antisemitism but rather exposes hypocrisy and inconsistency in people's behavior concerning antisemitic figures like Louis Farrakhan. Thus, it is not in itself antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 871: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it discusses a group of individuals (Anti-Zionist Jews) who believe that antisemitism ended after the Holocaust.

The tweet makes several claims that are based on antisemitic tropes: Jews are portrayed as having a secret plan to subvert the West, undermine capitalism (which is seen as a Jewish conspiracy in some forms of antisemitism), and promote communism to serve their own interests. This claim fits within the definition of antisemitism which includes accusing Jews of conspiring to harm humanity and using them to blame for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by others. It's also suggesting that Jews are only loyal to themselves and not to the countries they reside in, which can be classified as a form of dual loyalty accusation often found in antisemitic rhetoric.

The tweet acknowledges that there is a significant issue of antisemitism on the left but also points out that Jews have to clarify that it's not antisemitic to criticize Israel.

It criticizes a statement about the Jewish community's average income, questioning the source behind the assertion that Jews are \"rich.\" While it could potentially be seen as challenging a stereotype, it is not targeting Jews with hatred or blaming them for societal issues. Moreover, it doesn't call for harm, demonize, or dehumanize Jews, nor does it make allegations about collective Jewish power or behavior. The tweet focuses on an economic claim, and the question of how it relates to racism is a legitimate inquiry within a conversation around income inequality rather than an expression of antisemitic beliefs.\n",

This tweet can be considered antisemitic based on the provided definition, as it accuses Jews of playing a disproportionate role in the Apartheid-era policies of the ANC (African National Congress), thus promoting classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and control. It also implies that any positive aspects of the ANC's Freedom Charter were tainted by this alleged Jewish influence, thereby demonizing Jews for perceived wrongdoing. This falls under point 10 in your definition - applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation. In this instance, it is applied towards the Jewish people and their historical role within the ANC rather than modern-day Israel.\n",
      "Row 887: [0] 0. This tweet calls out the antisemitic behavior by criticizing those who offend Jews through comparisons to Hitler and argues against making such equivalences. Although it references Hitler, it does not employ this comparison to demonize or attack Jews. Therefore, according to your definition of antisemitism, it should be classified as not antisemitic. The author is highlighting the inappropriateness and unfairness of comparing a leader to Hitler, especially when it comes to offending Jews. This stance goes against many forms of antisemitism listed within your framework. For example, it does not apply double standards towards Israel or Jews, nor does it deny the Holocaust. Therefore, I would classify this tweet as non-antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 891: [0] 1. This tweet could be considered antisemitic due to its comparison of Louis Farrakhan's views to those of Hitler, which might imply the belief that Jews are inherently inferior or evil.

      "Row 900: [1] 1. This tweet may be interpreted as antisemitic by some due to the reference to \"imposters\" and the fact that Louis Farrakhan, a notorious antisemite, is associated with \"#Farrakhan\". The tweet appears to be targeting Jews by implying they are impostors or pretenders, which is a classic antisemitic trope. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine the intent of the user. If it were intended as a criticism against Farrakhan and his supporters, rather than being an expression of hatred toward Jews, then it might not be considered antisemitic.

      "Row 903: [0] 1. This tweet implies that the Republican Party, by embracing QAnon, could be repeating Hitler's lies about Jews and potentially seeking to repeat the Holocaust. While it doesn't directly call Jews or Israel \"collective names for Jews\", it does use the Holocaust as an analogy to critique the Republican Party's affiliation with QAnon. This can be perceived as antisemitic by drawing a direct and false equivalence between a political ideology (QAnon) and the Holocaust, which was perpetrated against Jews. It also implies that the Republicans are potentially targeting Jews through their association with QAnon, which is a hate group known for its anti-Semitic, racist, and xenophobic views. Although it does not explicitly mention Jews or Israel, it uses the Holocaust and antisemitism to make a political point about the Republican Party, making it potentially antisemitic.\n",

The tweet is expressing confusion about the perceived contradiction in political support rather than attacking or demonizing the group it mentions. Therefore, based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this specific tweet would not be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 914: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or ideas as defined by the provided guidelines. It discusses cultural practices and attire of different religious groups, including Brahmins wearing \"janeu\", without making any negative or hateful claims about them. Therefore, it is neither accusatory nor derogatory towards Jewish or Non-Jewish individuals or their property, Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Thus, according to the definition provided, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 915: [0] 0: This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. It criticizes Keir Starmer's actions related to Rebecca Long-Bailey's dismissal and accuses him of conflating Jews with the State of Israel, which could be seen as a criticism of his behavior towards Jewish people. While it does not praise Starmer's decisions, it is not making dehumanizing or demonizing statements about Jews, nor is it blaming Jews for wrongdoing committed by individuals who are neither Jewish nor Israeli. Instead, the tweet appears to challenge Starmer's actions and implies that they demonstrate a lack of understanding regarding Jews and their relationship with Israel. The tweet is critical of Starmer's perceived behavior, but does not target or harm Jewish people or institutions. Therefore, this would be classified as 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 916: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or sentiments. Instead, it acknowledges the user's Jewish heritage and condemns remaining silent in the face of injustice, which is a call for action against discrimination and violence, rather than perpetuating them.\n",
      "Row 917: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly or excessively blame all Jews for specific wrongdoings or actions and instead criticizes a specific individual (Lipman) for his alleged allegiance to another nation over the one he lives in. This critique can be seen as criticism of an individual, rather than a blanket statement about Jewish people as a collective group. Therefore, while the tweet might imply some negative or unjust assumptions about some Jews, it is not categorically antisemitic by the definition provided. The focus on one individual (Lipman) and questioning his loyalty, while potentially critical or judgmental, does not meet the criteria for labeling as inherently antisemitic according to your guidelines. It is crucial, however, that this interpretation be considered within the overall context of an individual's statements and actions on social media platforms, especially given the historical and contemporary manifestations of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 918: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly or indirectly attack, blame, or demonize Jewish people or Israel. The content of the tweet suggests that the author was part of a campaign-making process and they have asked it to be deleted, hoping that an appeal to younger Jews will work if the campaign is reattempted. While it does refer to \"Jews under 70,\" it is not in a negative or disparaging way, nor does it contain any antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, or comparisons typically associated with antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 919: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred, nor does it contain any of the antisemitic tropes or behaviors listed in your definition.

Therefore, this tweet cannot be classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 920: [0] 1. The tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it makes a generalized statement about all Jews being responsible for everything happening in the world, which falls under the category of dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective (point 4). This tweet perpetuates harmful and false stereotypes that are often used to blame and harm Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 921: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote antisemitic ideas or tropes; instead, it critiques stereotypes in general and uses examples including antisemitic tropes but does not express them as facts or endorse the tropes themselves.

      "Row 922: [0] 0. According to the provided definition, this tweet does not contain antisemitic content. It is a quote from Islamic historical texts, which discuss the punishment for adultery under Islamic law at that time. While it includes the mention of Jews, it does not express hatred or target Jews specifically as a group. The tweet doesn't employ any of the contemporary examples of antisemitism mentioned in the definition, and it doesn't relate to the modern state of Israel. Therefore, this tweet is classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 923: [0] 1. This tweet suggests that antisemitism is essential in the foundation of Western civilization, which directly contradicts the definition of antisemitism provided. It further claims that Western ideology and progressivism define themselves against Zionism (which is a strong connection to Israel), thus potentially making it antisemitic. However, the tweet also highlights that this ideology was developed using Judaism and Jews, which seems contradictory since it simultaneously maligns Judaism and Jews as part of Western civilization's \"building blocks.\" The overall intent and impact of the statement could be interpreted as antisemitic by many due to its dismissal of antisemitism and the claim that it has positive implications in society. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet should be classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 924: [0] 0. While this tweet does express an opinion about religion, it does not fit into any of the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by your definition. The tweet is addressing a different religious group (Islam) and their alleged historical actions towards Jews, which contradicts the idea that Islam is inherently or universally anti-Semitic. Furthermore, this statement could be seen as criticism against Islam rather than being antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 925: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet any of the criteria listed for antisemitism. It acknowledges the historical presence of Jewish-Israeli families in Israel and highlights that there are many Jews living there currently.

There is no indication of hate, stereotyping, or demonizing Jewish people or the state of Israel in this tweet.\n",
      "Row 926: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the criteria of antisemitism according to the provided definition, as it is questioning a specific aspect (slavery) from Jewish history, without expressing hatred or using stereotypes towards Jews. While the statement might be incorrect regarding the Biblical story and its debunking, the tweet itself is not intended to attack or demonize Jews but rather engage in discussion about historical contexts.\n",
      "Row 927: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes and instead, it condemns the idea of Jews being the enemy. It is critical towards people who hold that belief and seeks to counteract it by stating the opposite, hence it is not in itself antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 928: [1]  This quote is from the Quran (not a tweet), but considering it, it can be antisemitic based on this definition if taken out of context or if used to promote hatred towards Jews and Christians. The statement itself doesn't target Jews with hatred or demonization, so strictly speaking, it might not fit into the list of 10 examples provided for antisemitism directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, antisemitic interpretations or misuse of religious texts can fuel prejudice and intolerance. If someone were to use this Quran verse as a justification for avoiding friendship with Jews and Christians in general, that would be indicative of an attitude of prejudice towards Jews and Christians, which could potentially manifest into antisemitic behavior or beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the quote itself does not directly fall under any specific example of antisemitism provided in this definition, but it can become part of antisemitic attitudes if misinterpreted or used to justify hatred towards Jews in a specific context.

      "Row 929: [0] 0. While the tweet does reference antisemitic tropes (holding Jews responsible for Israel's behavior), its context does not support or propagate any form of hatred towards Jews. It is critical towards the idea that all Jews should have an opinion on Israel's behavior, suggesting potential interpretation in the light of classic antisemitic tropes. However, this alone does not make the tweet inherently antisemitic as it critiques the idea rather than supporting or perpetuating anti-Jewish sentiment.\n",
      "Row 930: [0] 0. Although the tweet contains a comparison to antisemitic events during World War II (Nazi Germany), it is not an endorsement of such beliefs nor does it target Jews or Israel directly. It uses this analogy to criticize people who support a political figure while ignoring their negative actions or stances, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism as long as it doesn't target Jewish individuals or institutions specifically. In this case, the comparison is not made in order to dehumanize or demonize Jews, but rather to criticize those who support a particular political figure without considering their actions.\n",
      "Row 931: [0]  0. This tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jewish individuals, even though it uses stereotypical and generalizing statements about Jews and Palestinians. It criticizes the actions of a political group (PA) without targeting all Palestinian people. The focus is more on criticizing PA's lack of development rather than attacking a specific ethnic or religious group. However, be cautious of similar tweets that may lean towards antisemitic sentiments due to their stereotypical language or generalizations about Jewish and/or Palestinian individuals.\n",
      "Row 932: [0] 0. The given tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic rhetoric or tropes, nor does it target the Jewish community with hatred or demonization.

As such, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition and should be classified as (0).\n",
      "Row 933: [0] 0. This tweet calls out antisemitic propaganda and its potential effect on Jews living in the United Kingdom.

      "Row 935: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the provided definition as it highlights the seriousness of historical events against Jews during the Holocaust and encourages people to use their voice to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future rather than silence them. While it mentions the user's grandparents being Jews and victims of the Holocaust, this information is used to emphasize the importance of using one's voice rather than to attack or demonize Jewish individuals or Israel.\n",
      "Row 936: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any of the antisemitic behaviors or beliefs defined within our parameters. While it references Jews in the context of \"Model Minority Group\" and \"American Jewry,\" there is no explicit or implicit hate, bigotry, or negative stereotype present against Jewish individuals or the state of Israel. The tweet seems to be discussing societal constructs (specifically the 'Model Minority' concept) rather than propagating antisemitic rhetoric.\n",

It discusses religious beliefs and affiliations among Jews and Christians without using dehumanizing or demonizing language, nor accusing Jewish people collectively for wrongdoings or criticisms of Israel. The content of the tweet is related to theological aspects rather than expressing hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 938: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote hatred towards Jews or demonize them. Instead, it addresses a misconception about Jewish behavior during the Holocaust.

This statement critiques a common myth often perpetuated by antisemites but it itself does not promote any form of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 939: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it makes dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective (suggesting they should \"wake up\" and move to a different state).

      "Row 940: [0] 0. While the tweet criticizes Fox News for having a viewership that includes individuals with hatred towards various groups (including Jews), it is not specifically targeting or demonizing Jewish people themselves.

Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet is not classified as an instance of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 941: [1]  Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. It seems to draw a comparison between the number of Jews and Brahmins along with their respective historical contexts.

      "Row 943: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to contain any antisemitic language or rhetoric. Instead, it highlights the continuous questioning of different groups within Judaism and the constant need for Jews to defend their existence as Jews.

Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 944: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any hate speech, dehumanization or demonization towards Jews or Israel. Instead, it discusses a common argument used in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about the right to land based on indigeneity.

      "Row 945: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly or indirectly attack or demonize Jewish individuals or the Jewish people as a whole, nor does it employ any antisemitic tropes commonly found in antisemitic speech. Instead, the tweet expresses disapproval of the US-Israel relationship and anticipates that Democrats and American Jews will be offended by this political decision. The criticism is directed towards the decisions made by the Israeli government, not at Jewish individuals or the Jewish people themselves. This distinction aligns with the definition provided which states that antisemitism should target Jewish individuals or their institutions and religious facilities, not necessarily the state of Israel. Therefore, this tweet, though expressing disapproval for a political action, is not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 946: [0] 1. This tweet contains several antisemitic elements according to the provided definition. Firstly, it falsely claims that Jews control media, finance, and the world, which is a common antisemitic conspiracy theory. Secondly, it likens this person's actions and beliefs to those of the Nazis, who believed in the same conspiracies about Jewish control over various institutions. Finally, it supports someone proud to be compared to Hitler, who was one of the most notorious and brutal antisemites in history. Therefore, the tweet is clearly antisemitic and should be classified as 1.\n",
      "Row 947: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicitly antisemitic language or tropes, and it seems to be critiquing a decision made by countries during the Holocaust rather than blaming Jews collectively for their fate.

      "Row 948: [0]  Based on the definition provided, I would classify this tweet as not antisemitic (0). The author of the tweet acknowledges that immigration by Jews has positively impacted the country and culture. While the second part of the statement might be perceived as insensitive due to a generalized comment about \"their\" dreadful religion, it is not specifically targeting Judaism or Jewish people in a negative way or promoting hatred towards them. The focus of concern seems to be on the overwhelming numbers and their religious beliefs rather than being inherently antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 949: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided, as it references a quote by Martin Niemöller that refers to the inaction and complicity of non-Jewish Germans during the Holocaust, highlighting the dangers of bigotry and intolerance. It is not an instance of antisemitic rhetoric or targeting Jews specifically, but rather a call for unity against all forms of persecution.\n",
      "Row 950: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language or tropes, but it rather calls out the hypocrisy of anti-Zionist arguments. While it mentions \"der Judenstat\" (referring to Israel as the Jewish state), it is critical towards those who argue for equality within a nation, while excluding its own citizens from basic rights in their home countries. Hence, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 951: [0]  0. The tweet does not mention or promote any of the antisemitic tropes or sentiments listed in the definition provided, such as dehumanizing stereotypes about Jews, blaming them for wrongdoings, or questioning their legitimacy as a nation.

      "Row 952: [1] 0. This tweet cites the biblical concept of \"the Synagogue of Satan\" which is often used by some individuals in a way that accuses all Jewish people, whether practicing or not, of being part of this group. However, it does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews, nor does it make demonizing, dehumanizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. This tweet is not antisemitic in itself since it calls attention to a specific biblical reference, rather than promoting antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 953: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic in itself. It criticizes the expectations some people have for Jewish individuals standing up against antisemitism, implying that these demands are unfair and unreasonable compared to what other minority groups face. While it references Jews and antisemitism, its intent is to highlight the inequality and hypocrisy of certain attitudes towards Jewish activism rather than promoting or perpetuating anti-Jewish sentiment.\n",
      "Row 954: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic as it references and highlights the Holocaust, a traumatic event in Jewish history. By referring to \"piles of hair shaved from the Jews,\" which is a reference to the atrocities committed against Jewish people during the Holocaust, this tweet perpetuates the memory of these horrors and uses them as a form of accusation or reproach towards others, implying that they are not properly outraged or concerned about such historical events. This can be perceived as demonizing Jews by emphasizing their persecution in history. While the author's intention might be to criticize apathy or indifference towards atrocities, the language used and reference to a specific group of people (Jews) could easily lead others to interpret this tweet as an attack on Jewish people themselves rather than those who are perceived as uncaring about the Holocaust.\n",
      "Row 955: [0] 0. This tweet does not seem antisemitic according to the definition provided. While it talks about \"equat[ing] opposition to global police violence with hating us\", it is referring to the hypothetical act of others, rather than expressing hatred towards Jews itself. It criticizes this misrepresentation or conflation, rather than promoting antisemitic sentiments. There's no direct insult or generalization about Jewish people as a collective in the tweet, so it does not fit into the definition of antisemitism outlined.\n",
      "Row 956: [0]  0. This tweet does not fall into the category of antisemitism according to the provided definition. It is a sarcastic statement about asking a large number of Jews a question, but it does not contain any hateful rhetoric or demonizing allegations toward Jews or Israel. The mention of \"6,000,000 Jews\" refers to the historical event of the Holocaust and is not being used in a way that supports antisemitic ideas.\n",
      "Row 957: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly exhibit antisemitic behavior or language. Instead, it addresses the issue of how J.K. Rowling's depiction of goblins in her Harry Potter series might be misconstrued and exploited by bigots to make anti-Semitic claims. The author calls for more awareness from authors about their representations and acknowledges that there may have been a missed opportunity on this matter. This tweet is critical towards the misuse of fictional characters and does not engage in antisemitism itself.\n",
      "Row 958: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote hatred or violence towards Jews and is rather highlighting historical instances of persecution against the Jewish community, which may have contributed to their suspicion of Christians.

While it discusses a tragic event in history, it does not fit into any of the listed examples of antisemitism provided in the definition you've given.\n",
      "Row 959: [0] 0. While this tweet criticizes Peter Schiff for not understanding \"black oppression,\" it does not contain any antisemitic language or ideas targeting Jewish individuals or Israel. The content of the tweet focuses on a criticism of a specific individual, rather than perpetuating antisemitic tropes or hatred toward Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 960: [0] 1. This tweet is likely to be considered antisemitic because it references an alleged \"Jews rule the world\" conspiracy theory and does not condemn or distance itself from these ideas. Although the user claims to be explaining the context rather than agreeing with it, this could potentially embolden harmful stereotypes associated with antisemitism. Moreover, citing a known antisemitic trope can contribute to perpetuating the idea that Jews do indeed control or rule over global affairs, which is a classic antisemitic claim. While the intention of the tweet might not be malicious, the reference itself is problematic and aligns with the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 961: [0]  0. Although the statement contains some negative language about Republicans, it does not contain any explicitly antisemitic tropes or accusations towards Jews or Israel. The tweet is more focused on critiquing the inconsistency between Republicans' perceived actions and their supposed dislike of Jews, rather than directly attacking Jews or Israel with hate speech. Thus, although it may be contentious and could potentially provoke further misunderstanding, it does not meet the definition of antisemitism provided in this context.\n",
      "Row 962: [0] 0. This tweet is a humoristic reimagination of the interaction between GOD and MOSES.

The tweet does not target Jewish individuals with hatred, nor does it call for the harming or dehumanizing of Jews.\n",
      "Row 963: [0]  1. The tweet is antisemitic based on the definition provided. This is because it suggests that \"Jews\" trending is inevitably going to be related to antisemitism, thereby promoting the idea that all discussions or mentions about Jews are inherently negative or hateful.

      "Row 964: [0] 0. The given tweet does not contain any language that explicitly or implicitly expresses hatred towards Jews or promotes stereotypes or conspiracies about the Jewish people. Rather, it is calling out internal divisions within the Jewish community and urging them to focus on fighting antisemitism instead of engaging in arguments between themselves. While it mentions 'Jews on Twitter,' it does not target any individual or institution specifically. Therefore, the tweet cannot be considered as promoting or perpetuating antisemitic ideologies or actions.\n",
      "Row 965: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism, as it is criticizing Trump's potential actions towards Social Security and Medicare, rather than targeting or demonizing Jews specifically. While it mentions the Holocaust and the number of Jews killed by Hitler (6 million), it is comparing that historical event to a hypothetical future impact of Trump's policies on Americans receiving social security and medicare benefits, not directly attacking Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 966: [0] 0. This tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to the given definition. The author of this tweet is criticizing a specific narrative about Jews being passive during the Holocaust, and expressing their strong disagreement with it. This critical stance towards the stereotype rather than promoting it makes the tweet not antisemitic by nature.\n",
      "Row 967: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes. It accurately refers to the historical background of Jewish settlement in Palestine, and the mentioning of differences between Middle Eastern nationalities does not imply hate or harm towards Jews or Israel.

      "Row 968: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or ideas. The user is addressing a potential misconception about the relationship between anti-Israel sentiments and antisemitism, and they are providing a clear distinction between these concepts.

This tweet does not attack or demonize Jews or Israel, and it is not in itself an antisemitic statement.\n",
      "Row 969: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or ideas. It quotes a verse from the Bible (specifically, John 4:22 in the King James Version) and refers to the concept that salvation comes from the Jews. The tweet is simply sharing a biblical reference and discussing its meaning within the context of religious beliefs.\n",
      "Row 970: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it uses a classic antisemitic trope, which is the allegation of Jews having too much power and control over various aspects of society, including the media. The Holocaust denial or questioning of its extent, along with demonizing Jews as a collective, fall within the definition of antisemitism. In this case, accusing Jews of controlling the media fits these criteria, as it is a stereotypical and dehumanizing allegation often made about Jewish people. Therefore, the answer would be 1 and the reasoning is based on the classification system provided for identifying antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 971: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, because it does not target Jews with hatred, nor does it make dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. The tweet refers to a specific person (Weev) discussing their experiences in prison and does not generalize this experience to the entire Jewish community. Additionally, it does not show any explicit intention of accusing Jews or Israel of wrongdoing. It is essential to remember that simply mentioning \"Jews\" or making a reference to Judaism or Israel does not automatically qualify as antisemitic. The context and intent are critical factors in determining whether the tweet exhibits antisemitic tendencies.\n",

It seems to be a neutral statement about certain individuals being criticized by naturalists and deists. No explicit or implicit hate or blame is directed at Jews or the Jewish community.\n",
      "Row 973: [0] 0. The tweet seems to criticize someone who is being accused of \"blaming the Jews\" by attributing it to their political stance as a 'left-winger'. Although this statement contains an antisemitic trope, it does not use it in a demonizing or dehumanizing way towards Jewish people. It rather highlights an unfair accusation that left-wingers are being labeled with. Therefore, while the tweet references an antisemitic stereotype, its context and intent do not qualify as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 974: [1]  Based on the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet can be considered antisemitic. The statement \"everything is 'anti-Semitic' when the truth about the Jews comes out\" suggests that any critique or exposure of alleged wrongdoings by Jewish individuals or entities will be labeled as \"anti-Semitic.\" This insinuates that criticism against Jews or Israel, regardless of its nature, is unfairly demonized. This mentality often serves to protect Jewish individuals from legitimate scrutiny or hold them exempt from accountability. Therefore, the tweet supports and perpetuates the idea of accusing Jews or Israel as a whole for any real or imagined wrongdoing - a hallmark of antisemitism. Thus, my answer is 1 and the tweet is indeed antisemitic according to this definition.\n",
      "Row 975: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, because it is drawing attention to a current issue facing Yemenite Jews and expressing concern for their safety and well-being. Although it refers to an oppressive situation that Jews are experiencing in Yemen, the tone of the tweet is one of solidarity and empathy rather than hate or demonization. The mention of \"Never Again\" may evoke historical contexts like the Holocaust, but it is not used here to blame all Jews for any wrongdoings, nor does it employ any of the other criteria specified in the definition as examples of antisemitic behavior.\n",

It is critical of the fact that some histories receive less recognition compared to others, and this can be seen as a call for more attention towards those histories. However, without further context, it's essential not to assume antisemitic intent based on vague historical references alone.\n",
      "Row 1048: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The tweet assumes that the person it is addressing (LadyVelvet_HFQ) has a preference or loyalty towards Jews and suggests that they are unable to criticize them due to their \"wiseness.\"\n",
      "2. It uses the word \"sadly\" in a sarcastic manner, implying disappointment that the addressed person is not supporting the suffering of Muslims in Palestine. This insinuates that they believe there is a conspiracy or unfair favoritism towards Jews at the expense of other groups, specifically Muslims in Palestine.\n",
      "3. The tweet questions why there seems to be no concern for the suffering of Muslims in Palestine while assuming that the addressed person \"loves\" Jews. This comparison and implication can be seen as promoting antisemitic tropes, which associate Jews with a lack of compassion or empathy towards others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this tweet uses rhetoric and insinuations that fit within the definition of antisemitism. It targets an individual while indirectly criticizing the entire Jewish community by suggesting they have ulterior motives or are unconcerned about non-Jewish suffering.\n",
      "Row 1049: [0]  0. The provided tweet does not contain any of the antisemitic tropes, language, or sentiment defined in your guidelines, nor does it target Jews, Jewish individuals or institutions, or Israel directly.

Thus, this tweet is not classified as an instance of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1050: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews, nor is it targeting Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities. It is simply referring to a particular group of people (Hasidic Jews) in the context of potential unrest.

It also does not target Israel or question its legitimacy or existence.\n",
      "Row 1051: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes, stereotypes or hateful language against Jewish individuals or institutions. It only discusses a situation involving a group of Jews who observe the Torah's Commandments facing harassment on the street and questions if this constitutes an argument. While it may not be constructive, it does not exhibit any antisemitic intention or behavior as defined in the given parameters.\n",
      "Row 1052: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it compares the subject (presumably a non-Jewish person) to a German in the 1930s who doesn't hate Jews but supports Adolf Hitler and his anti-Semitic policies, implying that the individual holds similar beliefs or attitudes towards Jewish people. The tweet uses a form of classic antisemitism (e.g., blaming all Germans for their government's actions), thus it is considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1053: [0]  0. This particular tweet does not contain any language or rhetoric that falls under the definition of antisemitism provided earlier. It appears to be a statement expressing solidarity between Jews and lesbians, which is not indicative of hatred towards Jews.

      "Row 1054: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic content, nor does it target Jews or Israel with hatred. Instead, it argues against the claim that Israel is an apartheid state by listing various rights and privileges afforded to Arab citizens of Israel.

Thus, it is not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1055: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly express hatred towards Jews or contain any antisemitic tropes. The tweeter is expressing concern about a situation involving a protest, comparing it to the challenges faced by Jews during the pandemic. While the comparison could be interpreted as an oversimplification or lack of understanding of the full context of Jewish gatherings' restrictions during the pandemic, it does not directly target Jews or make any dehumanizing or demonizing statements about them.

Instead, it is criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement for using Jews as scapegoats in a situation where it is more appropriate to address systemic issues within the United States police force and society at large. While it is problematic that this tweet perpetuates a negative stereotype of the BLM movement, its primary purpose is not to promote antisemitism but rather criticize their tactics.

      "Row 1057: [0] 0. This tweet criticizes the Fox News network for allegedly hosting individuals who hold prejudices against different groups of people, including Jews.

      "Row 1058: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or vilify Jewish people, and it is employing an analogy to criticize the concept of \"Women for Trump.\" The examples given in this analogy do not allude to antisemitic tropes or harm towards Jews.

Although one can argue that \"Jews for Hitler\" has been historically used to imply Jewish complicity with Nazism, which is an antisemitic trope, the overall intention of this tweet is not to propagate hatred or antisemitic beliefs towards Jewish people or their religious and cultural community. Instead, it's using a provocative analogy as a rhetorical device to criticize the Women for Trump movement. Therefore, it should be classified as non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1059: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism provided since it is criticizing a media outlet (Fox News) for catering to different groups of intolerance, but it does not specifically target Jews or Judaism in a derogatory manner.

Therefore, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1060: [1] 1. The tweet suggests that all Jews are forced into accepting Zionism due to some sort of psychological manipulation during their early years. This statement perpetuates a stereotype about Jewish people and implies that they cannot hold independent opinions or beliefs, which can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.

This tweet does not use any antisemitic tropes or expressions typically associated with hate towards Jews, and it appears to call out hypocritical behavior among women without targeting them specifically for being Jewish.

      "Row 1063: [0] 1. This tweet contains several elements that could be considered antisemitic:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The mention of \"jihaad again\" may imply violence or conflict directed towards Jewish individuals, which falls under the category of manifesting hatred toward Jews.\n",
      "- The reference to \"Camunist,\" which seems like a misspelled combination of \"Communist\" and \"Zionist,\" can be interpreted as an attack on Jewish individuals or institutions that might hold progressive political views. \n",
      "- The phrase \"so called enlightenment of the followers of Jews and christen\" suggests that the author does not consider Judaism and Christianity to be valid religions, which could be a way of dehumanizing or demonizing these groups.\n",

Therefore, according to your guidelines, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1065: [0] 1. The tweet contains inaccurate historical references, comparing the U.S. government's actions (if any) with that of Hitler and Nazi Germany's horrific treatment of Jews. This comparison is a form of antisemitism because it invokes the Holocaust, a traumatic event specifically targeting Jews, to criticize or compare with unrelated situations, thus tarnishing the historical tragedy by trivializing its significance. Additionally, it can be interpreted as questioning the legitimacy of the existence and actions of Jewish people and their government (in this context, the state of Israel) – a frequent tactic in antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1066: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the provided definition, despite discussing a historical conflict and its consequences on both sides. It refers to a specific event in history (the arrival of Jews in Haifa after 1948) and provides information about the circumstances under which it happened, without employing stereotypes or hateful language towards Jews or Israel.

      "Row 1067: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly contain antisemitic language or ideas and instead calls out the false idea that all Jews are \"disloyal\" to Israel if they don't vote for certain political parties, which is a stereotype.

      "Row 1069: [0]  0: This tweet is not antisemitic because it does not display hatred or prejudice towards Jews, but rather expresses the importance of using one's voice to address injustices faced by their Grandparents who were Jews. The user acknowledges that remaining silent is a part of the problem and not the solution. While there might be an implication that some individuals are silencing the speaker's voice or not listening, it does not target Jews or Israel with prejudice or hatred.\n",
      "Row 1070: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions.

      "Row 1072: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it does not express hatred towards Jews or target Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities.

The comparison between the past rescue efforts and current criticism is used to provoke thought about historical actions rather than spreading hate against Jews.\n",

      "\n",
      "The user is invoking a historical analogy to compare the current situation of Polish Jews with that of the Jewish people in Germany in the 1930s. This comparison serves to trivialize or demonize the experience and suffering of these individuals, which could be considered antisemitic. Furthermore, the reference to \"Die Stürmer,\" a notorious Nazi newspaper known for its anti-Semitic propaganda, is a clear allusion to historical anti-Jewish sentiment. Both elements suggest that this tweet seeks to perpetuate negative and stereotypical views of Jews, thus supporting my classification as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1075: [0] 1. The tweet exhibits an underlying misconception about the term \"Semitic\" and is attempting to manipulate its meaning, potentially leading to confusion or misunderstanding. It incorrectly suggests that Jews have hijacked the word Semitic, implying a sense of deceitfulness or manipulation on behalf of Jews.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tweet also seems to assert that the fight for the rights of Semitic people is limited only to Jews, ignoring the existence and experiences of other Semitic peoples. This can be interpreted as an attempt to sow division among different groups within the broader category of \"Semitic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It further proposes renaming antisemitism to \"antijew,\" which not only mischaracterizes the term but also reduces the concept to a singular group, rather than recognizing that it is a phenomenon experienced by individuals and communities who identify as Jewish or belong to the broader category of Semitic peoples.\n",

It also links Judaism to the religion of Islam in a negative context which is not accurate or appropriate and can fuel hatred towards both religious groups. The statement \"those who sold idols and conspired with the Catholic Church to destroy him\" is antisemitic, as it blames Jews for the actions of another group (the Catholic Church) and uses it to justify hostility toward Jews.

It is historically accurate and does not exhibit any of the characteristics described as antisemitic, such as accusing Jews or Israel of wrongdoing collectively, demonizing or stereotyping Jews, or questioning the existence of a Jewish nation state like Israel. Instead, it provides historical context about a particular time during World War II.\n",
      "Row 1113: [0] 0. While this tweet does make a comparison to the historical events of World War II, it is not inherently antisemitic. It compares two political extremes - those who believe in exterminating Jews in 1938 and present-day Democrats who allegedly view \"Patriots\" as evil and call for their re-education or extermination. The comparison itself is critical of both the historical event and the modern political stance, and therefore, it does not express hatred towards either Jews or Democrats. It is crucial to differentiate between comparisons that aim to illuminate a similarity in extreme thinking rather than perpetuate prejudice.\n",

The use of the term \"fake Jews\" and \"Khazars\" could be seen as a reference to the antisemitic conspiracy theory that most Jews are not descended from ancient Israelites, but rather from Khazars, a Turkic people who converted to Judaism in the 8th century. This theory is widely discredited by historians and geneticists.\n",

Although this tweet contains a religious viewpoint about Jesus Christ, it does not express any hatred or persecution towards Jewish individuals or institutions as defined in the guidelines provided. While the statement about the rejection of Jesus by Jews may be contentious within certain discussions, it is not presented in a way that demonizes or dehumanizes Jewish people.

      "Row 1118: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or demonize Jews or Israel, but it criticizes an action that is associated with Nazi Germany and the oppression of Jews.

The focus of the tweet is on the use of intimidation tactics, comparing them to historical atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against Jews, and not on Jews themselves or on Israel as a nation. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, it does not qualify as an antisemitic statement. Instead, it is more likely criticizing current events or political actions that are being associated with intimidation tactics, which could potentially be seen as undemocratic or oppressive. It may be important to note that while the comparison to Hitler and the Nazis can indeed evoke strong feelings, it might not necessarily be antisemitic if used as a means of criticism for what is perceived as injustice or abuse of power, rather than targeted hate against Jews or Israel.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. It refers to Ahmad Erekat as a \"terrorist\" after an incident where his vehicle was involved in a collision with a group of Jews. While it is true that this person might have committed a crime, the term \"terrorist\" is often used in antisemitic contexts to demonize and spread fear about Jews or Jewish actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tweet implies that Erekat's act was intentionally targeted towards Jews due to his last name (Erekat). This association of a person with their religion (in this case, assuming the person is Muslim due to their last name) is antisemitic because it demonizes an entire religious group based on the actions of one individual.\n",

      "3. It also blames the victims (the group of Jews involved in the incident) for their own suffering by suggesting that \"maybe her son shouldn't have tried to murder a group of Jews.\" This statement is an example of victim-blaming and perpetuates antisemitic tropes about Jews being responsible for their own mistreatment.\n",

The accusation of the organization being owned by Jews can be seen as a misinformed statement rather than antisemitism.

While this tweet refers to a mayor's request to \"hasidic jews,\" it does not express hatred, demonization, or stereotyping of Jewish people based on the antisemitic tropes mentioned in the definition provided.

The author clarifies that Judaism can be practiced as both a religion and an ethnicity, and they differentiate between those who were born into the faith and those who converted.

      "Row 1178: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition. It seems to be referencing a joke or meme about Jewish people being \"chosen\" and using that as a basis for humor, rather than attacking or demonizing Jews or their beliefs.

      "Row 1180: [0]  1. The tweet seems to use a common antisemitic stereotype by suggesting that some Jewish individuals may not be \"real Jews.\" This is problematic because it implies that their Judaism or Jewishness is somehow inauthentic, which goes against the fundamental principle of respecting the individual and community's self-identification. Additionally, comparing these alleged \"fake\" Jews to evangelical haters of Trump is a dehumanizing act, as it attempts to diminish the legitimacy and authenticity of both groups.

      "Row 1188: [0]  Based on the definition provided, this tweet is not antisemitic. It calls out historical actions by Russia during World War II, specifically their invasion, occupation, and atrocities committed against Poland and its Jewish population under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop secret protocol. The focus is on accusing Russia of their own violent history, rather than targeting Jews or the state of Israel. Therefore, I would classify this tweet as 0 (not antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 1189: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic tropes that accuse Jews collectively of controlling various industries and countries, which fall under points 3, 4, 7, and 9 of the definition provided earlier.

      "Row 1195: [0] 0. Although the tweet mentions \"the Jews,\" it is not explicitly antisemitic as it does not contain any of the aforementioned tropes or negative characterizations of Jewish people or Israel. The author seems to be criticizing Ari for being bad for Jewish interests but without any underlying hatred, demonization, or stereotyping of Jewish people themselves. It is essential to note that context and intent play vital roles in assessing whether a statement constitutes antisemitism. In this case, the tone appears critical rather than hateful or prejudiced towards Jews, and thus, it does not fit the provided definition of antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 1196: [1] 1. The tweet implies a stereotype about Jewish control and influence over Canadian affairs, which is an example of dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective.

      "Row 1197: [0] 0. According to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not appear to be antisemitic on its own. It's making a general observation about Jewish people purchasing certain car models without any negative intent or demeaning stereotyping. However, it is essential to consider the context and possible intentions of the user posting this tweet. If they are promoting or reinforcing other forms of antisemitism, then the context would change the classification.

      "Row 1198: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly mention or target Jews, nor does it contain any of the typical antisemitic tropes listed in the definition provided. Instead, it criticizes Democrats for their actions during the pandemic, and implies that it's unlikely Biden can unite the nation due to these perceived actions. This criticism is directed at Democrats as a political entity, not specifically against Jewish individuals or Israel.\n",
      "Row 1199: [0]  0. This tweet does not classify as antisemitic according to the definition provided, because it calls out the misconception that all Jews are responsible for the Israeli government's actions and policies.

While it is critical towards this misperception, it does not contain any antisemitic tropes or engage in antisemitic behavior.\n",
      "Row 1200: [0] 0. The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic traits according to the provided definition. While it refers to the \"oppression of Jews,\" it is critical of those who make such comparisons, rather than perpetuating antisemitic ideas or tropes. It is a call for people to be more informed and careful in their wording, not an expression of hatred towards Jews or any attempt to demonize or blame them.\n",
      "Row 1201: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitic according to the guidelines provided, despite containing criticism of antisemitism itself. While it references various forms of antisemitism (left-wing, right-wing, and medieval), its overall message is to highlight the danger and irrationality of all forms of Jew hate, not to promote or support them. The author acknowledges that antisemitism comes from both left and right sides of the political spectrum, which indicates they are calling out antisemitic behavior rather than engaging in it themselves.\n",
      "Row 1202: [0]  0. This tweet does not directly contain any of the criteria of antisemitism laid out in the provided definition, nor does it make a blanket statement against Jewish people or Israel. The tweet condemns an act of violence towards \"Jews for Trump\" demonstrators and encourages conservatives to secure President Trump's re-election. While \"Jews for Trump\" can be associated with Jewish individuals who support President Trump, the tweet's main focus is on the act of violence against any political group, rather than specifically targeting Jews or making antisemitic claims. Thus, according to the provided definition, it cannot be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1203: [0] 0. This tweet does not target or demonize Jewish individuals or their community directly. Rather, it criticizes Fox News for attracting people with hateful attitudes towards various groups, including Jews. While the tweet mentions \"people who hate Jews,\" it is using this group as one of many examples to illustrate the issues with Fox News. The overarching focus is on criticizing Fox News and its audience, not on promoting or expressing antisemitism. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1204: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit into the categories of antisemitism mentioned in the definition provided. It refers to a comparison between a Christian theologian and his relation to the Holocaust, where the theologian is said to have been silent about it. While there might be some underlying issue regarding the silence or action (or lack thereof) of a specific religious figure during the Holocaust, this tweet does not target Jews or Jewish people as a group or individual. It is instead focused on the theologian's actions and their relationship with history rather than promoting hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 1205: [0]  1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it compares a political figure to Hitler and implies that her supporters are \"enabling\" another tyrant in the same way that people did during the Holocaust. The tweet also links this comparison with the suffering of six million Jews who were killed during the Holocaust, which is historically inaccurate and deeply offensive. This use of antisemitic tropes and the manipulation of historical events to malign a specific individual or group can be seen as an attempt to incite hatred toward Jews and further marginalize them, thus it should be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1206: [0] 0. This tweet does not explicitly target or demonize Jews, but rather discusses the challenges they face in Europe and America.

Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1207: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly contain antisemitic rhetoric or content and instead discusses the internal divisions among Jews. It acknowledges that not all Jews have the same opinions, but it does not demonize or blame any group of Jews for problems within their community. While the tweet touches upon different perspectives on Zionism, it is not antisemitic in itself as it expresses understanding and does not promote negative stereotypes about Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 1208: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any language or ideas that fall under the definition of antisemitism provided. It merely states a fact about the belief systems of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism regarding the concept of God.

      "Row 1209: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism. It does not contain any explicit or implicit hatred towards Jews nor does it target Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities. While it mentions \"Jews,\" there's no malicious intent behind it and it doesn't express any perceptions that could be considered antisemitic based on the given definition. It is a light-hearted remark about certain perceived traits of Jews (alcohol consumption and size), which doesn't align with the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1210: [0] 0. This tweet expresses disapproval of a president's actions and content on their website, specifically mentioning the targeting of various groups, including Jews, Blacks, Asians, Hispanics.

      "Row 1211: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes, dehumanizing statements, or false accusations toward Jews or Israel. It acknowledges historical hardships faced by both the person's grandmother and great-grandmother due to antisemitism in Eastern Europe, which aligns with the factual history of Jewish persecution. While it refers to \"Jews\" as a group, this is not done in a negative or dehumanizing way; rather, it serves to illustrate the personal connection and historical context the author has with their own family's experiences related to antisemitism. As such, it does not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1212: [0] 0. This tweet expresses a sentiment of concern for Orthodox Jews due to their visibility and potential exposure to anti-Semitic attacks. It does not contain any negative or stereotypical allegations against Jews, nor does it target the Jewish community with hatred or demonization. Instead, it recognizes that certain individuals within the Jewish community may be critical of the Israeli government's actions, which suggests a nuanced understanding rather than promoting antisemitic tropes. Thus, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1213: [0]  0. This tweet criticizes religious texts for promoting hatred or violence towards certain groups but does not target Jews or Jewish people directly. It mentions the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Quran without explicitly endorsing or supporting them. The criticism of these texts is more generalized rather than specifically antisemitic. The part about Humza's snp-stasi and a transwoman being considered a man does not align with any definition of antisemitism provided above. Thus, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1214: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitic as it is not expressing hatred towards Jews or promoting any form of discrimination, dehumanization, or demonizing of Jewish people or their institutions and religious facilities. It simply argues that equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is incorrect and emphasizes on understanding the distinction between being a Zionist and being pro-Jews. The tweet does not target Jews or Israel in a negative manner, so it cannot be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1215: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes. Instead, it shares a personal experience of working with Jewish immigrants who had survived the Holocaust and emphasizes the narrator's willingness to listen to their experiences. While it does mention the survivors' tattoos and their traumatic past, this context is presented in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, focusing on understanding their stories.\n",
      "Row 1216: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or rhetorical manifestations of antisemitism, but rather critiques a historical action committed by certain Jewish people without directly targeting Jewish individuals or the Jewish community as a whole. The critique should be seen as a critique on specific individuals and/or institutions from the past that were involved in this activity, not as a broad generalization against Jews today. It is worth noting that some Jewish groups have indeed critiqued and condemned the historical involvement of Jews in slavery, which adds another layer of context to this critique. The tweet does not accuse all contemporary Jews or Israel of perpetuating such actions, nor does it use antisemitic tropes or make demonizing claims about Jews or Israel as a collective. It is crucial that we differentiate between historical facts and modern-day antisemitism when evaluating these kinds of statements.\n",
      "Row 1217: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism as it calls out a broader issue involving various groups that President Trump has allegedly denounced. It is critical toward his alleged actions without targeting Jews or Israel specifically, nor applying double standards to them. While it mentions 'Jews' alongside other minority groups, its focus is on criticizing the inconsistency and hypocrisy of Republicans rather than expressing hatred towards any particular group.\n",

While it criticizes certain Jewish individuals and groups, it does not exhibit any of the characteristics associated with hatred towards Jews or the demonization and stereotyping of them.

      "Row 1220: [0]  1. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet contains an element of antisemitic rhetoric as it alleges that Jews control everything (an antisemitic trope).

      "Row 1224: [1] 1. The tweet appears to express the view that \"Both\" (presumably referring to a political candidate) are equally evil, and this evil is attributed to being controlled by the Jewish lobby. This attribution of power and control to Jews as a collective aligns with several characteristics of antisemitism listed in the provided definition. It suggests that Jews, as a group, wield significant influence over these politicians, thus imposing their will on others - a recurrent trope in antisemitic discourse. The attribution of this power to \"jewish lobby\" is especially significant given that there's no such recognized entity as 'Jewish lobby', and the term is often used to imply a secretive, all-powerful group manipulating events from behind the scenes, which is a common antisemitic trope.\n",

The tweet mentions \"Jews in 1930's Germany\" and \"African slaves in the 1700's\" as groups that had a higher suicide rate than trans people, which implies a comparison to suffering experienced by Jews during the Holocaust and the oppression of African slaves. This kind of rhetoric can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize or trivialize Jewish experiences of suffering by drawing an equation with the extreme examples of oppression provided. Additionally, it seems to downplay the current struggles faced by transgender individuals by comparing them to the historical atrocities suffered by Jews and African slaves.\n",

Firstly, it attempts to draw an equivalence between the Holocaust and the experiences of German POWs during World War II, which is a clear distortion of history and an inappropriate comparison. It trivializes the unique and horrific nature of the Holocaust by suggesting that the suffering of Jews was no worse or different from that experienced by German POWs. This type of rhetoric often seeks to deny the specific anti-Semitic intent behind the Holocaust and instead present it as merely a tragic event in history, rather than an attempt to exterminate an entire ethnic group due to their religious identity. \n",

This tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it states that Jews are \"not the real children of Israel\" and accuses them of \"extorting America.\" These statements dehumanize Jewish people by questioning their rightful connection to Israel and insinuating that they are acting dishonestly or maliciously towards America.

While it refers to a verse from the Quran that discusses the duties of Muslims towards other religions, including Jews and Christians, it is not specifically targeting or demonizing Jewish people or Israel. The focus here appears to be on the education and influence of \"Mullahs in madrassa.\" Although there can be underlying issues with religious extremism in some interpretations of Islam, this tweet alone does not fit the definition of antisemitic according to the provided guidelines.\n",

This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or rhetoric itself, but rather discusses the historical background of the Swastika symbol and its misappropriation by Nazi Germany.

Instead, the author highlights historical misconceptions regarding Jewish rights in Israel and argues that the current consensus might be wrong as well. While some might argue that questioning the legitimacy of Jewish claims to Judea and Samaria could be considered antisemitic under certain interpretations, this tweet does not employ hateful language or rhetoric. Instead, it focuses on challenging a prevalent belief and encourages critical thinking.\n",
      "Row 1244: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes and is critiquing Richard Dawkins rather than targeting Jews or Israel.

This phrase has become a dog-whistle for antisemites who believe Jews are trying to replace white populations through immigration or assimilation.

      "\n",
      "1. It implies that Jews are satisfied with their situation and have built a successful, peaceful country, while the Palestinians and surrounding Muslim countries are portrayed as causing trouble.

The tweet is simply expressing shock at the individual's response towards certain questions asked about Left-wing Jews.\n",

The tweet can be seen as an observation of societal prejudices throughout history rather than inciting hate or promoting antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1264: [0] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic elements as it directly accuses people of hating Jews simply because they express discomfort with the statement, and implies that it's acceptable or even expected for people to hate Jews. The implication that \"we've always been hated\" also perpetuates a stereotype about Jews being persecuted throughout history. These elements suggest that the author is promoting hatred towards Jews and potentially justifying antisemitic behavior, making this tweet antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1265: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic in itself, as it does not express hatred toward Jews or make any stereotypical, demonizing, or dehumanizing allegations about Jewish people.

      "Row 1268: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its reference to Jews having a \"number\" tattooed on their arms, which evokes images of the Holocaust and implies that all Jews should be held accountable for past atrocities.

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it calls out the antisemitism targeted towards Black Jews and addresses issues within the Jewish community. The tweet criticizes individuals who blame Black Jews for experiencing antisemitism and those who victim-blame or attack them when discussing their experiences with hate.

      "Row 1428: [0]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it portrays all Jews in a negative light by accusing them of partnering with \"colonialists and attackers of Arabs.\" It does so by using the platform of The New York Times, suggesting that their editorial choices are influenced by an antisemitic perspective. This tweet not only dehumanizes Jewish people collectively but also misrepresents the role of Jews in defending themselves against aggression.\n",
      "Row 1429: [0] 1.

      "Row 1450: [1] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism because it is questioning a common belief (the trope that Jews rule the world or have disproportionate power) rather than spreading hateful rhetoric toward Jewish people or Israel.

      "Row 1451: [1] 0. This tweet does not promote hatred or stereotypes towards Jews. Instead, it corrects the misinformation presented in another tweet and cites facts about a historical event.

      "Row 1452: [1] 1. This tweet does not directly accuse Jews or Israel with antisemitic tropes such as dehumanization, demonization, or conspiracy theories; however, it is critical of the Israeli state's policies towards its Arab citizens and uses language that may imply bias against them. Given that the definition of antisemitism includes targeting the Israeli state for actions it takes towards its citizens, and this tweet does just that, I would classify it as potentially antisemitic (1). It is essential to note that while the focus is on the Arab minority in Israel, the underlying implication of bias or unfair treatment against a non-Jewish group within Israel could be seen as an indirect expression of antisemitism. Additionally, it may also evoke feelings of animosity toward Jews or support for antisemitic attitudes if interpreted by individuals with pre-existing biases.

The tweet is antisemitic according to the given definition, as it refers to \"left-wing Jews\" being purged by Keir Starmer and implies that they are not the 'right kind' of Jew based on their political beliefs. This rhetoric targets Jewish individuals with a negative connotation, implying that their worth or loyalty is tied to their political stance rather than their own individual values or rights.

      "Row 1460: [0] 0. The given tweet does not meet any of the 12 criteria provided for antisemitic behavior or content within this context. It is an invitation addressed specifically to \"American Jews\" to come to Britain which, while not entirely neutral and might carry some implicit assumptions about why one would want American Jews there, it is neither explicitly nor inherently demeaning, prejudicial, or hateful towards Jewish people or Israel. While the use of 'oh' before \"American Jews\" can sometimes be used to express surprise or incredulity, in this context it doesn't seem to imply any derogatory intent and could simply be a casual way of phrasing the message. It is not targeting the existence of a Jewish state, accusing Israel or Jews collectively of wrongdoings, nor is it using tropes that have been traditionally used to vilify Jewish people (like blaming them for killing Jesus).

This tweet is not antisemitic as it highlights a problem within the Labour Party regarding the suspension or expulsion of Jewish members and expresses concern about how these actions are making left-wing Jews who support Palestinian rights feel unwelcome.

The user's reference to a \"Jewish Space Laser\" also mocks the Holocaust Remembrance Day trend of placing a Star of David next to an image of a satellite or the International Space Station as an ironic response to conspiracy theories involving the Jewish community and space-based weapons.

The tweet implies that the actions of the German government during the Holocaust directly correlate with the present situation in Nigeria, specifically referencing leaders @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo without explicitly providing any contextual evidence or parallels between the two cases.

The use of \"mad men\" to describe political leaders may be seen as a general insult rather than specifically targeting Jewish people or the state of Israel; however, it is still in poor taste when considering the Holocaust's historical significance. Therefore, while not explicitly antisemitic, it could potentially be perceived as insensitive and could contribute to a degradation of the gravity of the Holocaust in conversations about other political issues.

      "Row 1491: [0]  0. This tweet does not express antisemitic sentiments or target Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, the user references historical tactics employed by tsarists before 1917 that are unrelated to contemporary antisemitism.

      "Row 1494: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the given definition. The author of this tweet is condemning neo-Nazi violence, specifically mentioning that they are targeting Jews in synagogues. They also express concern about far-right, antisemitic members of Congress enabling violent insurrections and worry that people might \"both-side\" the Jewish American community, implying a potential downplay or equivalence between right-wing antisemitism and left-wing sentiments, which they argue do not have an equivalent. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews, nor does it target them with dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations, which the definition of antisemitism mentions as criteria for identifying antisemitic content. Therefore, this particular tweet does not fit the description of an antisemitic statement according to the provided guidelines.\n",
      "Row 1495: [0] 0. This tweet does not qualify as antisemitic because it does not express any hatred or prejudice towards Jews nor does it call for the harm of them. Rather, it calls out an unfair generalization and targets people who are discussing anti-Semitism in the context of Israel when there's no direct connection to it. The tweet is criticizing the act of using a discussion about anti-Semitism as a platform to discuss Israel unnecessarily which is not inherently antisemitic, hence my answer is 0.\n",
      "Row 1496: [0] 0. Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not appear to be promoting or expressing hatred towards Jews as a group nor is it accusing them of wrongdoings or conspiracies.

Thus, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to your definition.\n",
      "Row 1497: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or ideas, but rather criticizes \"white privilege\" and promotes values of love, peace, and tolerance as taught by Jesus.

Therefore, it can be concluded that this tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 1499: [0] 1. This tweet is clearly antisemitic according to the given definition, as it echoes the genocidal intent of Nazi Germany towards Jews during the Holocaust. It reiterates a historical event that was aimed at the total extermination of European Jewry and suggests that this \"matter\" should not be intervened by external forces, thus justifying and encouraging such actions. This statement is directly targeting Jewish individuals or their property, targeting Jewish community institutions and religious facilities (in this case, symbolically), and accuses Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. The reference to the historical event also implies that such actions are justified as an \"internal matter\" of a country, which is a common antisemitic trope used by antagonists towards Jewish communities. Therefore, the tweet can be categorized as antisemitic based on the given definition.\n",
      "Row 1500: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or Judaism with hatred, nor does it spread stereotypical allegations about Jewish people or the power of Jews as a collective. While it mentions the fear experienced by Jewish individuals due to recent events (nazi flags and \"camp auschwitz\" clothing), it does so in order to highlight that these actions pose a threat not only to Jewish communities but also other marginalized groups, thus emphasizing their shared vulnerability and promoting solidarity. The tweet's focus is more on addressing the issue of hateful symbols and actions rather than antagonizing Jews or Judaism itself.\n",
      "Row 1501: [0]  Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet does not appear to be overtly antisemitic. However, it contains potentially harmful stereotypes and a misunderstanding of historical context, which could potentially be harmful in certain contexts.

      "The author compares two different situations (one involving Jesus and another unrelated situation), implying that Jews acted according to what Jesus said literally.

      "It is also worth mentioning that the tweet's overall tone and language are not explicitly hateful or prejudiced against Jews. The author uses the term \"lol\" (laugh out loud) to convey humor, which could be interpreted as a casual dismissal of the comparison rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on this analysis, I would classify this tweet as not antisemitic. However, it's important to keep in mind that context and intent play crucial roles in determining whether a statement is antisemitic or not.

      "Row 1504: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism because, although it mentions \"an elected US leader\" and \"antisemitic conspiracy theories\", its main focus is to inform non-Jewish friends about a humorous situation involving a joke about Jews and space lasers. The author also acknowledges that there's a serious side to the situation due to an elected US leader spreading antisemitic ideas, but their primary goal isn't to promote hatred or prejudice towards Jewish people. Instead, they are using humor to raise awareness about a larger issue related to antisemitism.\n",

      "Row 1509: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain antisemitic language or display any prejudice towards Jewish individuals or Israel. Instead, it's expressing curiosity about the difference between Jewish people who identify with their religion and cultural practices and those who may consider themselves more secular or only relate to certain aspects of Judaism, such as enjoying lox on Sundays.

      "\n",
      "Explanation: This tweet is antisemitic because it reinforces the conspiracy theory that Jews, specifically \"woke\" ones, are secretly pushing for progressive causes like LGBT rights in order to lower white birth rates.

      "Row 1513: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language. It discusses a historical perspective on Jewish national revival and the concerns of assimilated German Jews regarding Zionism, which is an important aspect of understanding the historical context of the movement towards the creation of Israel. While some may view Zionism with disagreement, this tweet does not express hatred or target individuals or their property, nor does it use dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 1514: [0]  0. The tweet does not directly make an antisemitic statement or use antisemitic tropes against Jewish people, but rather cites FBI stats to criticize hate crime trends during the Trump administration. It includes Jews alongside other groups like blacks, Hispanics, and Asian Americans as those who experienced a rise in hate crimes, which is not inherently antisemitic. While it does mention Jews in the context of increased hate crimes, the focus remains on the broader issue of hate crimes across different demographics.\n",
      "Row 1515: [1]  0. This tweet does not display any antisemitic behavior or tropes. It quotes a passage from the Bible (John 8:31-42) that emphasizes the importance of Jesus' teachings and the truth they provide.

      "Row 1517: [0] 1. This tweet contains various aspects that could be considered antisemitic according to the definition provided. Firstly, it refers to \"Hitler\" which is often used in an antagonistic context and in this case, it is referring to a historical figure who committed genocide against Jews. Secondly, the reference to \"the jews being just a religion so we can’t target them if they convert,\" perpetuates the myth that Jewish identity is solely defined by religious belief, which ignores the ethnic and cultural dimensions of Jewishness. Additionally, it falsely suggests that Hitler didn't target Jews due to their religious conversion, when in fact, he targeted Jews regardless of their beliefs or lack thereof.\n",

It instead highlights shared elements of religions coexisting within Israel.\n",
      "Row 1530: [0] 1. According to the provided definition of antisemitism and the context given for tweet classification, this tweet can be considered as antisemitic (1). The tweet lists various forms of violence and terror attacks, which were not carried out by all Jews or even the state of Israel. It also seems to suggest that the Jewish people are collectively responsible for these actions, and it uses a negative tone towards the Jews, making it fall under the definition of antisemitism. Additionally, this tweet targets a group of people based on their religious affiliation, which is another indicator of an antisemitic tweet according to your guidelines.\n",
      "Row 1531: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or Jewish collectives with hate speech or demonizing language, and instead criticizes an individual who is accused of spreading hatred toward Brahmins. While it refers to how Nazis propagandized against Jews, the context implies that the person being critiqued in the tweet is doing something akin to what the Nazis did, rather than expressing antisemitic sentiment themselves. Therefore, although the reference to Nazi propaganda may evoke feelings of discomfort due to its historical association with persecution and genocide against Jews, it does not classify as an instance of explicit anti-semitism in this specific case.\n",

The term \"Nakba\" refers to the Palestinian exodus that occurred in 1948 during the establishment of Israel, which is a historical issue related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than a hateful attack on Jews or Judaism.\n",
      "Row 1533: [0]  0. Although this tweet highlights the difference in religious representation among nations, it does not display any elements of antisemitism as defined.

      "Row 1557: [0] 1. This tweet clearly falls under the category of antisemitism, as it calls for harming Jews and justifies their mistreatment by claiming that it is an internal matter of the country (implying Germany in this context). It also goes against the principle of \"denying the Holocaust\", which is considered a form of antisemitism. The quote is attributed to Hitler, who is known for his genocidal policies towards Jews and other groups during World War II. The tweet promotes ideas that are associated with classic antisemitic tropes and incitement to violence against Jews, thus it's categorized as 1 - Antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1558: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition, as it correctly narrates a historical event - the Night of Broken Glass or Kristallnacht, without any derogatory remarks towards Jews.

The user discusses historical events involving a government's economic policies, without specifically targeting Jews or Israel. They are simply pointing out that certain groups were excluded from unemployment figures in those times, without making any explicit accusations against Jews or Judaism. Although the mention of \"jews\" and their exclusion may evoke associations with antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and influence, the tweet is not using this for rhetorical purposes nor targeting individuals or institutions related to Judaism or Israel.

Instead, it makes a direct comparison between an event (Kristallnacht) that happened during the Holocaust and another unrelated event (Wednesday), explaining why the two events are different. By doing so, the tweet serves to correct misinformation and educate readers on the historical significance of Kristallnacht.\n",
      "Row 1563: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it describes Israel as an \"ugly\" country and contrasts this depiction with a more normal one of Iran's government, implying that the Jews in the description are negatively portrayed while the Iranian leaders are presented fairly.

While it references the Holocaust and the Nazi regime, the tweet is discussing a broader theme of inciting hate towards political groups.

      "Row 1570: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its insensitive and dehumanizing language referring to groups of people, specifically mentioning Jews along with others (Anarchists, Romani, and non-cishets). It also uses a reference to the Holocaust, in which Jews were killed by fascist regimes, including the German Nazi regime. The tweet mocks and trivializes the suffering of these groups during this time, as well as the ongoing oppression faced by marginalized communities today.

      "Row 1571: [0] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic content due to its reference to the Holocaust and its dismissal of the genocide of six million Jews as \"a minor\" issue, which is both inaccurate and disrespectful. Additionally, the use of profanity and violent language towards another user further escalates the hostility and indicates a desire for that person to be silenced or removed from the platform. This combination of factors aligns with the definition of antisemitism as a perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.\n",

The tweet also demands action (resignation or expulsion) against the Republican member of Congress who made such a claim.

The author also clarifies that if Israel wanted to eliminate the Palestinians entirely, it could do so quickly, emphasizing that the two situations are not equivalent. While mentioning the Holocaust and the suffering of Jews is sensitive, the tweet does not use these historical events as a basis for demonizing or attacking Jewish individuals or Israel, nor does it engage in hateful speech towards Jews or Jews collectively.

This statement demonstrates an intentional usage of the Holocaust as a weapon against Jews and Israel in contemporary discourse. It also implies that Germany has some obligation towards Jews, which can be seen as an attempt to hold Jewish people responsible for wrongdoings committed by other non-Jews throughout history.

The use of \"German\" and \"Nazis\" in this context is an antisemitic trope that demonizes a specific group, implying that those being addressed are similar to people who committed genocide against Jews during the Holocaust.

Therefore, this tweet can be classified as not being antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1651: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, according to the provided definition, because it connects violent actions and groups (Proud Boys) with antisemitic rhetoric (\"Jews will not replace us\").

This statement has its roots in antisemitic ideologies and is used as a tool to incite hatred and violence towards Jewish individuals. While the tweet itself may not be inciting violence, it perpetuates dangerous stereotypes and should be classified as antisemitic.\n",

This tweet is not antisemitic, as it critiques the content of another source and questions why only Jewish people and concentration camps are shown, implying a lack of representation or balance in that context.

Additionally, the statement \"Why don’t you just come out and say what we all know - that you despise Jews.\" suggests that the author of this tweet assumes that disliking Israeli policies is inherently linked with hatred towards Jews, which is not a fair assumption to make.

      "Row 1679: [0] 0. Although this tweet does mention alleged racism in Israel, it is not inherently antisemitic. The user does not target Jews or Israeli citizens collectively nor promote hatred towards them. Instead, the message appears to express concern about the existence of racism within a certain group, and questions whether it aligns with the values of American Jewry. This criticism can be observed in many discussions regarding any country's educational system or societal issues, without necessarily being antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1680: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly target or demonize Jewish people nor does it contain any of the specific examples of antisemitism mentioned in the provided definition. While the word \"Jews\" is used, the message is more about commenting on the fact that certain individuals or groups have access to bomb shelters than propagating hatred towards Jews.

      "Row 1681: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. It criticizes police actions and expresses concern for racial inequalities in the United States without directly targeting or demonizing Jewish individuals or organizations.

This tweet is antisemitic, as it uses \"zionists\" (a term often employed to demonize Jewish people who support Israel) and suggests that criticism of Palestine is silenced in the same way Hitler's treatment of Jews was, while drawing a false equivalence between historical oppression against Jews during the Holocaust and the current situation in Israel-Palestine. Furthermore, it implies that there is an unjust silence around the alleged suffering of the Palestinians and suggests a double standard in how different groups are treated, which can be considered an antisemitic comparison.\n",

This tweet does not appear to directly target or demonize Jews or the power of Jews as a collective, and instead seems to focus on criticism of the global financial system and its potential influence, rather than attacking Jewish individuals or the Jewish community specifically. Although it refers to \"the Jews\" in the historical context of Jesus' actions at the Temple, it does not use this reference in a hateful or demeaning way towards contemporary Jewish people or institutions.

      "1. It references the Holocaust and its traumatic impact on Jewish people, using it as a weapon against a specific group of individuals (in this case, Jews living in Poland) to accuse them of past violence.\n",

      "Row 1696: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes, and instead challenges the narrative of \"The Nakba\" (the Palestinian exodus during the establishment of Israel), which is a complex and contentious historical event. The tweet questions the idea that Arabs left their homes solely because of Israeli actions, suggesting that the conflict was also due to Arab refusal to accept partition and the onset of war. While some might argue that this narrative dismisses Palestinian suffering or paints Jews as victims instead of aggressors, it is not inherently antisemitic.

      "Row 1697: [0] 0. The tweet does not explicitly express hatred toward Jews or use stereotypical allegations about Jews. Instead, it criticizes the Palestinian leaders' actions and their allocation of resources.

The tweet is critical of the leaders' actions and policies, which can be seen as not being in themselves antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1698: [0] 0: This tweet does not contain any antisemitic content or language, but rather expresses a strong opposition to antisemitism and support for combating it.

      "Row 1710: [0] 1. This tweet appears to reference a specific historical context and not specifically targeting or attacking individuals of the Jewish faith today, but it does contain an element of antisemitism due to its use of historical tropes that have often been weaponized in antisemitic discourse. Specifically, the phrasing \"the Jews\" could be interpreted as a homogenous group, which is one characteristic of antisemitism outlined in your definition. Therefore, based on your definition and considering that this tweet lacks any explicit criticism or condemnation of the historical context it references (it does not explicitly argue against misinterpretations, misapplications, or oversimplifications), I would classify this tweet as antisemitic. It's essential to note that without more context surrounding the conversation it is taking place in, it might be difficult to determine its intent and to fully assess whether it meets your definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 1716: [1]  0. This tweet does not fit into the definition of antisemitism as it primarily discusses Hitler's policies regarding Germany's economic prosperity, rather than targeting or demonizing Jews specifically.

      "Row 1717: [1]  This tweet can be considered antisemitic (1) due to several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The tweet uses the term \"Jewish ethno-national apartheid state\" to describe Israel, which is akin to comparing it to the South African apartheid regime and thus falls under point 1 of your definition.\n",

      "Row 1719: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or hateful language towards Jews. Instead, it corrects a mistaken belief about Palestinians and emphasizes the long history of oppression faced by Jews.

      "\n",
      "1. The phrase \"Jewish engagement party\" suggests a stereotype about Jews controlling events or influencing decisions (point 4 in the definition). It implies that the author believes Jews hold more power than they actually do, and this is used as an excuse by Dan to extend the lockdown.\n",
      "2. The tweet also suggests that the extension of the lockdown was predetermined regardless of any \"Jewish engagement party\". This further strengthens the idea that the author believes Jews have a significant influence over events (point 4).\n",
      "3. The phrase \"Redirecting people's anger at Jews\" suggests that the author believes in a conspiracy where the anger of people is directed towards Jews, which could imply blaming Jews for wrongdoings (point 5 in the definition).\n",

      "Row 1721: [0] 0. The tweet does not explicitly contain any antisemitic tropes or language and it is unclear how it refers to \"the Jews\". It could be referring to a potential escalation of a conflict between Israeli and Palestinian individuals, or other geopolitical issues involving the Jewish state, rather than making a statement about Jewish people in general.

      "1. The author of the tweet brings a comparison between the imprisoned Israeli filmmakers and 80,000,000 Biafrans (who identify themselves as Jews) and 50,000,000 Yoruba Christians held captive in Nigeria. This could be seen as an attempt to dehumanize or stereotype the Israelis by likening them to people who are traditionally considered victims of persecution (in this case, Jews and Christians in Nigeria).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tweet also implies that there is something inherently problematic about \"Private Israeli companies + Chabad\" being present in the situation, which could be perceived as an accusation of collective responsibility for the actions of these entities.\n",

      "3. The call to \"Wake up\" can be interpreted as a form of demonization or belittling, suggesting that the families and/or authorities are not acknowledging the gravity of the situation because they have connections to Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. However, the overall message appears more concerned with the welfare of the 80 million Biafrans and 50 million Yoruba Christians than it is antisemitic towards Jews or the state of Israel.

      "In conclusion, I would classify this tweet as potentially antisemitic (1). While it doesn't explicitly use hateful language towards Jews or the state of Israel, it does make certain comparisons and assumptions that could be interpreted as dehumanizing or stereotyping.

      "Row 1723: [1]  This tweet can be considered antisemitic (1) because it makes two main problematic points according to our definition: firstly, by stating that \"America's Jews\" have used political influence to fund the Israeli apartheid state without proper regard for Palestinian lives, this generalization targets all Jewish individuals or institutions. This can easily be interpreted as suggesting that Jews collectively hold responsibility for the actions of Israel. Secondly, the statement \"it’s wild to hear Jews in America say they are not responsible\" implies a denial or dismissal of individual Jews' ability or right to dissociate themselves from the actions of the state of Israel, which is a form of dehumanizing or demonizing allegations against Jews.

It rather criticizes the inclusion of documents accusing Jews (in a broader sense) of committing horrible things, and labels this action as antisemitic.

      "Row 1733: [0] 0. The tweet criticizes those who accuse Jews of being involved in the 9/11 attacks, stating that it was Bush and the Saudis who were responsible. This criticism is not targeted at Jews or promoting any antisemitic tropes; instead, it counters misinformation about Jewish involvement in the attack. The tweet does not contain any hatred, demonizing, or stereotyping of Jews or their power collectively. It's not an endorsement of antisemitism but a response against its propagation.\n",
      "Row 1734: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements of antisemitism according to the definition provided. The author uses the terms \"zionist\" and \"apartheid state\" to negatively describe Israel, which can be seen as an attempt to dehumanize and demonize both the Jewish nation and individuals who support it. They also falsely assume that anyone of Jewish faith is either a zionist or lives in Israel, further perpetuating antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 1735: [0] 0. This tweet does not promote hatred or express any prejudice towards Jews, rather it is promoting introspection and the need to stand against all forms of hate and bigotry regardless of the targeted group. It highlights that it's necessary for everyone, including Jews, to combat bigotry in all its forms. While it mentions a few examples (Jews being scapegoated and not supporting #lgbtq), these are not directed at Jews or Judaism with hatred or prejudice, but rather point out inconsistencies that the author believes should be addressed. The tweet does not target Jews or Israel specifically nor does it employ any stereotypes or tropes commonly associated with antisemitism. Thus, although it points out issues within the Jewish community and mentions an alleged bias against the LGBTQ community, these are not presented in a way that would be considered antisemitic under this definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1736: [0] 0. The provided tweet does not explicitly target or demonize Jewish individuals, and it does not promote antisemitic tropes or ideas that are commonly associated with hate speech towards Jews.

Therefore, in this context, it cannot be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1737: [0]  0. The provided tweet does not directly contain any of the elements identified in our definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 1738: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user is discussing the Soviet Regime's suppression of nationalist sentiment, and they mention that Russians, Ukrainians, Central Asians, Baltics, Jews, etc., were all suppressed as identities unless it served a purpose. There are no explicit or implicit antisemitic tropes or accusations in this tweet. It is critical toward the Soviet Regime for suppressing multiple national identities and does not target Jewish people with hatred or blame them for anything.\n",
      "Row 1739: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the provided definition. It discusses differing interpretations of religious texts and personal beliefs, without using antisemitic language or tropes typically found in antisemitism. The tweet is focused on a debate around religious texts and beliefs, rather than targeting Jews or Israel with hateful rhetoric or accusations.\n",
      "Row 1740: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It merely shares historical facts about the transportation of Jews to concentration and extermination camps during World War II.

      "Row 1741: [0] 0. This tweet does not seem to exhibit antisemitic content based on the definition provided. It compares Kim Jong-Un's love for Americans to Adolf Hitler's view of Jews, but it is critical towards both leaders and not directed at Jewish people. Additionally, it doesn't target either Jews or Israel directly with hate or demonization.\n",
      "Row 1742: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes, slurs, or expressions of hatred towards Jews. It simply observes an action done by a certain person (presumably AOC), which is to hug Jews.

      "Row 1743: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it claims that all bloodlines are from a single \"Father\" and that the so-called \"O NEGATIVES\" are the true Jews, not a religion. This type of rhetoric demonizes Jewish people, implying they aren't truly following their faith but rather have some shared \"bloodline.\" This statement falls under the definition of antisemitism by dehumanizing and stereotyping Jewish people. The tweet also implies that it is only this specific group, the O NEGATIVES, who are true Jews, thus excluding all other Jewish individuals or groups from being considered \"true\" Jews. This statement perpetuates harmful myths about Jewish identity and reinforces negative stereotypes associated with Judaism.\n",
      "Row 1744: [0] 1. The tweet describes a situation where an individual outside of AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) is calling Jews \"Nazis\" for supporting Israel. This behavior aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it involves targeting Jewish individuals or their property, and is hateful towards them. Additionally, this tweet highlights that Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic member of Congress, had such an individual at her swearing-in ceremony, which indicates an association between the Democrat party and antisemitic behavior, as it suggests that they might endorse or overlook such actions. The overall tone and content of the tweet expresses concern and disgust towards the antisemitism observed within the Democratic Party, making it a suitable candidate for being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1745: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or rhetoric, nor does it target Jews or Israel in a negative manner.

It criticizes the situation by calling for an end to what it perceives as an invasion and expresses frustration with those they view as misinterpreting the term \"horribly intolerant.\" While the tweet does not specifically reference Jews or Israel, its primary focus is on the broader issue of immigration and perceived cultural clashes, rather than on Jews or Jewish issues. As such, it does not fit the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1748: [0] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it condemns antisemitism and acknowledges its negative effects on all people, including Jews, liberatory movements, and Palestinian activists. It does not contain any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective, nor does it engage in comparisons to Nazis or other tropes associated with antisemitism.

      "Row 1749: [0] 0. This tweet calls out antisemitic acts and expresses concerns about Senator Schumer's response to antisemitism, but it is not itself antisemitic as it does not contain any of the tropes or prejudicial language mentioned in the definition of antisemitism. It criticizes ignorance and prejudice, and does not target Jews or Israel with hateful rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 1750: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit directly into any of the listed antisemitic manifestations. It criticizes individuals who \"attack random Jews under guise of pro-Palestine solidarity\" and points out that such actions distract from the issue of Israeli oppression. While it mentions Palestinians and Israel, it does so in a critical manner rather than promoting or supporting antisemitic ideas. Therefore, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1751: [0]  0: The tweet is not directly antisemitic according to the definition provided. It mentions \"No Jews no news,\" which could be perceived as negative towards Jews, but it does not demonize or dehumanize them. Instead, the user appears to be responding to a comment that suggests some form of news bias due to Jewish involvement in media industries. However, the tweet is also not praising or supporting anything related to antisemitism, and instead, it brings up another issue: FreePalestine. In this case, the user seems to suggest using the \"#FreePalestine\" hashtag as a way of expressing solidarity for the Yazidi cause rather than promoting antisemitic ideas. While the tweet might not be worded perfectly, it can be seen more as a criticism towards news bias or an attempt at humor, rather than an expression of hate against Jews.\n",
      "Row 1752: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target Jews or Israel in a hateful or harmful manner, but rather acknowledges the rise of anti-Semitic incidents around the world and calls for condemnations of Antisemitism.

The tweet does not display hatred towards Jews or blame them for global issues, thus it can be considered as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1753: [0] 0. This tweet does not express antisemitic sentiment or hatred towards Jews. It references a Biblical passage (John 18:36) to illustrate the idea that Jesus' kingdom is not of this world, and it encourages unity among people regardless of their religious backgrounds or political affiliations. The comparison between an elephant (Republicans) and a donkey (Democrats) is common in American politics, and does not target Jews or Israel specifically.\n",

While it criticizes these individuals for promoting hateful narratives, it does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes, nor is it directly attacking Jewish people or institutions. Instead, the tweet seems to focus on condemning antisemitism among certain left-wing supporters and acknowledging that this is a problem. Thus, while the author of the tweet may be expressing concerns about growing antisemitism within a specific group, their own language and tone does not align with the definition provided for antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 1755: [0]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it features hateful speech targeted toward Jews by mentioning \"Jews rape women\" and associating them with an act of violence. The fact that this message is being displayed in front of the Holocaust museum adds a layer of intentional provocation, further emphasizing its antisemitic nature. It also attempts to dehumanize and demonize Jewish people by accusing them of heinous crimes, which falls under point 4 and 5 of the given definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 1756: [0] 0. While this tweet criticizes AOC's perceived prioritization, it does not express any hatred toward Jews or make antisemitic tropes. The focus is on critiquing her social media presence and its potential impact on the lives of people in Israel, rather than demonizing or dehumanizing Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, according to this definition, it's not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1757: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic content as per the provided definition. The tweet is merely citing a hadith from Prophet Muhammad about how future generations will follow previous nations' actions closely.

This tweet is not antisemitic in itself, as it raises a thought-provoking question about the concept of intersectionality and its application to Jewish individuals who are also white. While there might be some nuances regarding the specific aspects of how one might understand and apply the concept of intersectionality to this context, the tweet does not employ any antisemitic tropes or language that could be considered harmful or dehumanizing towards Jews or Judaism. It is essential to differentiate between addressing complex issues within a group and targeting an entire community with hateful or prejudiced rhetoric.\n",

      "Row 1764: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The author discusses historical figures and events that involve both non-Jewish (Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel) and Jewish individuals (Judas).

      "Row 1766: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or target them with antisemitic tropes or stereotypes, as it focuses on addressing the violent attacks against Jews in New York and highlights a disconnect between media/twitter rhetoric and the actual conduct and rhetoric from some activists regarding the Palestinian cause. It does not accuse Israel or Jews collectively of wrongdoing or compare them to Nazis or apartheid regimes, nor does it deny their right to self-determination or question the legitimacy or existence of Israel as a nation state.

This tweet is not antisemitic, as it criticizes the need for adding caveats when advocating for Jews due to conflations between antizionism and antisemitism, rather than explicitly expressing hatred or prejudice towards Jews or Israel.

Instead, it compares the current situation with wearing masks due to the pandemic to the historical experiences of Jews during persecution, highlighting the difference in scale between the two situations but also drawing an empathetic parallel. The comparison is not intended to demean, demonize, or blame Jews; rather, it is aimed at emphasizing the universality of suffering and the importance of understanding history to prevent future tragedies.\n",
      "Row 1770: [0]  Based on the provided definition and examples of antisemitic content, I would classify the given tweet as not antisemitic (0).

It does not directly target or demonize Jews or Israel with any of the definitions outlined above. While some might argue that option D (\"Jews uniquely have no right to a state\") could be interpreted as antisemitic, the overall purpose and context of this tweet seem to be about criticizing the inconsistency in criticism against Israel rather than promoting or propagating an antisemitic idea.\n",

      "Row 1772: [0] 1. This tweet contains multiple elements that may be considered antisemitic according to the definition provided: it compares the situation in India with the persecution of Jews by Hitler, which is a common antisemitic trope that seeks to demonize and blame Jews for their suffering at the hands of other oppressors. Furthermore, it implies that all Jews were collectively killed by Hitler, which also fits into the definition of antisemitism.

This tweet clearly fits within the definitions of antisemitism outlined in this task, thus I would classify it as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 1774: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains stereotypical and misleading statements about Jewish people being primarily settler-colonists in Israel and expelling native people from their homeland. The statement misrepresents the historical context of Jewish communities' return to the land following the establishment of the State of Israel, as well as the diverse demographics within contemporary Israeli society. It also applies a double standard by emphasizing on only one aspect of Israeli history while ignoring other historical realities and complexities.\n",
      "Row 1775: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or ideas, as it is requesting the provision of adequate security to Jews in India and tagging relevant authorities for that purpose.

      "Row 1776: [0]  0. While this tweet does cite historical antisemitic rhetoric that was used during the 1930's, it is not presenting or propagating any antisemitic sentiments itself.

It acknowledges that there are crimes against Jewish and Asian communities and claims that \"the people of America\" recognize these acts for what they are, rather than attributing them to white supremacy.

      "Row 1780: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic content or rhetoric. The user expresses a hope for peaceful coexistence between Palestinian freedom and Jewish safety, which is contrary to the notion of antisemitism.

      "Row 1781: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic. It highlights the historical tension between Arabs and the concept of Zionism but does not specifically target or demonize Jewish individuals or the broader Jewish community.

      "The reasoning behind this classification is that while the tweet mentions \"jews\" and discusses a narrative about their historical migration, it does not express any hatred towards Jews or target them specifically with stereotypical, dehumanizing, or demonizing allegations.

      "Row 1789: [1]  1. The statement \"Jews run Germany, just like the U.S.\" is antisemitic because it falls under the definition of contemporary examples of antisemitism, specifically point number 4 - Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. This statement assigns disproportionate control and influence to Jews in both Germany and the United States, which perpetuates antisemitic tropes about Jewish power and control over nations.\n",

This tweet calls out the potential antisemitic actions within the Labour Party, specifically by questioning why certain individuals are being accused of antisemitism and removed from the party. While it does not directly endorse or promote any antisemitic ideas, it is critical towards these actions within the political landscape, making it not inherently antisemitic.

      "Row 1803: [0] 1. The provided tweet is antisemitic because it accuses Jews of causing the expulsion of Palestinians and establishes Israel on the \"ruins of the destroyed villages\" without providing context or acknowledging the complex history leading up to these events. This statement denies the legitimacy of Israel's existence, which aligns with point 9 in the definition of antisemitism given earlier. While this tweet does not directly blame Jews for wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew (point 5), it implies that Jews as a collective are responsible for the expulsion and dispossession of Palestinians. The tweet also omits crucial historical context, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, multiple wars, and the UN partition plan which also contributed to these events.\n",

It merely mentions that a lot of Jews believe in a god but clarifies that it is not required to be Jewish, which can be considered a neutral or informative statement about Jewish beliefs rather than promoting hatred towards Jews or targeting them.\n",
      "Row 1816: [0] 1. This tweet does reference the Holocaust and the use of the yellow Star of David by comparing it to the different colored wristbands being used at the University of Bath, but in this case, it is not a direct attack against Jewish people or their community institutions. It's more likely an attempt to emphasize the seriousness of the current situation with COVID-19 and vaccinations. However, given that it uses an analogy with the Holocaust, which could potentially evoke negative emotions towards Jews or remind them of a traumatic historical event, it can be seen as antisemitic in nature, even if unintentional. It is essential to be sensitive and avoid making such comparisons, as they can contribute to spreading fear and hatred against Jewish communities.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. The reference to the Alphabet 🏳️‍🌈 people could be an attempt to create a parallel between a marginalized group (LGBTQIA+) and Jews.

This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or rhetoric; rather, it questions the premise of \"left-wing\" anti-Semitism based on a misconception about who Jews are and their connection to Israel or Zionism. Although it refers to a hypothetical group of Jews that might be used as a target for anti-Semitic sentiment, it is not employing this hypothetical group to promote hatred toward actual Jews or Judaism, which the definition you've provided would consider antisemitic. Instead, it seems more concerned with criticizing misguided or misinformed perceptions of who Jews are and their connection to Israel or Zionism. Thus, this tweet is not, in itself, promoting hate or prejudice towards Jews.\n",

This tweet is calling out hypocrisy in how some people choose to label certain Jews based on their political affiliations or stances, and it does not inherently express hatred toward Jews or promote any of the antisemitic tropes listed in the definition provided.

      "Row 1827: [0] 0. While this tweet references a stereotype about Jews and alcohol consumption (which could be seen as mildly offensive), it is not explicitly antisemitic according to the provided definition. The tweet does not express hatred or target the Jewish community, religious institutions, or individuals with malicious intent. It is more of a joke than an attack on the Jewish community. However, if you were more concerned about the presence of stereotypes in content and less about the explicit intentions behind it, you might classify this tweet as antisemitic (1).

      "3. The term \"token Jews\" implies that the tweeter believes these Jewish individuals are not representative or genuine in their beliefs and actions, which can be seen as an attempt to dehumanize them.

Therefore, the answer is 0.\n",

It references the famous \"First They Came...\" poem by Martin Niemöller, which highlights the importance of standing up against injustice and oppression regardless of one's identity. The tweet is a critical reflection on history and serves as a reminder for social responsibility, not to promote hatred or bigotry towards any specific group.\n",
      "Row 1833: [1]  1. The tweet contains a statement claiming that \"our kids\" (implied to be Palestinian) were killed by Israel, which is factually incorrect as various investigations and organizations have debunked this claim. However, the main issue with this tweet lies in its assertion that \"we can cooperate with Christian community but not with the Jews.\" This statement is generalizing an entire religious group (Judaism) based on a specific nation-state's actions (Israel), and it perpetuates an antisemitic stereotype. The author of this tweet is effectively stating that they have issues cooperating with all Jewish individuals, not just the Israeli government, which aligns with some of the definitions provided for antisemitism. \n",

      "While the statement doesn't explicitly accuse Jews of harming their children or blame them collectively for the actions of a nation-state, it does generalize and demonize an entire religious group based on the actions of its political representation - thus, perpetuating antisemitic tropes.

It talks about historical events concerning a country and its Jewish population without demonizing or blaming Jews for anything negative that may have occurred in the past.

This tweet does not exhibit any antisemitic language or behavior, and it is simply reporting on a news event related to Roman Abramovich's acquisition of EU citizenship through Portugal’s naturalisation scheme for descendants of Sephardic Jews. The information in the tweet is neutral and does not contain any rhetoric or tropes commonly associated with antisemitism, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions in a harmful way.

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism, as it mentions that many Jews hate Leftist-Fascism and authoritarianism, which are political ideologies rather than targeting Jews collectively or promoting hatred towards them. Although \"Jews\" is mentioned in the tweet, it doesn't portray Jews in a negative or stereotypical way, nor does it blame Jews for anything wrong.

It merely refers to a historical event in a manner that might be uncomfortable for some due to its sensitive nature but does not target Jews collectively with hatred or demonization.

This is factually incorrect as while Marx criticized the role of Jews in capitalism, he did not consider all Jews capitalists or use his criticism to justify antisemitism.

      "3. It also asserts that both Marx and Hitler targeted Jews nationally, again falsely conflating the political ideologies of socialism and national socialism (Nazism).

      "Row 1920: [0] 0. This tweet does not express antisemitic views but criticizes the past chants of \"Jews will not replace us\" and \"Send her back.\" It points out that the current \"Lets go Brandon\" chant is preferable to the previously mentioned antisemitic and racist phrases. The tweet is critical toward previous instances of hate speech rather than promoting or expressing hatred towards Jews or other minority groups.\n",
      "Row 1921: [0] 0. The tweet does not express hatred, demonize, or accuse Jewish people collectively of anything. It simply states that gentiles (non-Jews) were never instructed to tithe according to some interpretations of the Christian Bible.

Rather, it discusses a religious practice within Christianity and distinguishes between Jews and non-Jews in that context.\n",
      "Row 1922: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism as it is neither expressing hatred towards Jews nor is there any attempt at targeting Jewish individuals, institutions or their property. It is simply making an argument against unvaccinated people and using a metaphor that could be interpreted in different ways, but it doesn't exhibit the intent to attack or demonize Jewish people based on their religion or ethnicity.\n",
      "Row 1923: [1] 0. While this tweet uses colloquial language to express an affinity towards people of Jewish background, it does not contain any antisemitic tropes or hatred towards Jews. It is merely expressing a personal connection with individuals of Jewish descent due to their perceived desire for wealth. It should be noted that this statement would ideally require more context to ensure its intentions are fully understood; however, based on the limited information provided, it does not fall under the definition of antisemitism as per the guidelines you've shared.\n",
      "Row 1924: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit the criteria of antisemitism, as it calls out unfounded comparisons between COVID-19 restrictions and the Holocaust or Nazis, while also expressing disbelief in the cluelessness, dishonesty, or malignancy of those who make such comparisons. It does not contain any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or Israel, nor does it target individuals or institutions specifically based on their Jewish identity. Instead, it is critical of the comparison made between two different historical events and their perceived similarities by certain individuals.\n",

Instead, it critiques the British government's action on revoking citizenship without notice, and the perceived increase in racism after Corbyn's departure from the Labour leadership position. Although it references the number of 6,000,000 people which can be associated with the Holocaust (a historically antisemitic event), the context here is about the UK government's action on citizenship revocation rather than targeting Jewish individuals or communities specifically. Therefore, while potentially alluding to a painful historical context, this tweet does not directly manifest the specific characteristics outlined in the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 1926: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or antisemitic tropes towards Jews, and it doesn't target the Jewish community or the state of Israel with any manifestations of antisemitism as described in the definition.

      "2. The user goes on to refer to the subject as \"complete fucking assholes,\" which adds further insult and provocation without any context or justification.\n",
      "3. While it is true that one should not equate every criticism of a specific group with antisemitism, this tweet explicitly references Jews during a period of extreme persecution for the purpose of insulting its target. This association alone marks the content as potentially antisemitic.\n",

The context appears to be the COVID-19 pandemic and discussions about mask wearing in public spaces, suggesting that the user is comparing the perceived \"unmasked privilege\" of a particular group (likely referring to politicians or policymakers) with the oppression faced by Jews during the Holocaust. This comparison is baseless, highly offensive, and antisemitic.\n",
      "5. The language used in this tweet is inflammatory and serves no purpose other than to provoke and insult. It does not contribute meaningfully or productively to the discussion on public health measures or policy decisions during a pandemic.\n",

This tweet quotes a famous passage from Martin Niemöller, a German anti-Nazi theologian, to emphasize the importance of speaking out against injustices regardless of whether they directly affect oneself or others.

Though the language used might be inflammatory, it doesn't target Jews in an antisemitic manner, therefore, it should not be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1932: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or content. It compares unvaccinated individuals to those who could not walk out of Auschwitz, using the situation as a hypothetical scenario rather than attacking Jews or Israel.

This tweet does not express any hatred towards Jews, nor is it using antisemitic rhetoric or tropes in an attempt to dehumanize, demonize, or blame Jewish people collectively for real or imagined wrongdoing.

      "Row 1935: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or promote antisemitic tropes towards Jews or the State of Israel. It rather appears to express concern over potential consequences in the user's current political situation, drawing a historical comparison from World War II-era Germany.

Instead, the author acknowledges and respects the sacrifices made by these soldiers during a time when anti-Jewish persecution was widespread.\n",
      "Row 1943: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic as it is not expressing hatred or prejudice towards Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals, institutions, or religious facilities specifically. Instead, it makes a comparative observation between two different historical instances involving religious minorities being restricted from practicing their faith. While it might evoke feelings of discomfort or be seen as provocative due to its sensitivity, it is not attacking or demonizing Jews or Judaism directly and thus does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to this definition.\n",
      "Row 1944: [1] 1. The tweet makes a historical claim that Jews first appeared in the 8th century AD and were originally Arabs who spoke Arabic. This claim is historically inaccurate and distorts the origin of Judaism, which dates back thousands of years prior to the 8th century AD. It also misrepresents figures from Jewish history such as Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon, all of whom are significant figures in Jewish tradition dating back much earlier than the 8th century AD. This type of claim is often used by antisemites to cast doubt on the legitimacy and authenticity of Jewish identity and history.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"Jewish state is a Zionist hoax\" further supports the idea that the tweet is antisemitic, as it questions the existence and legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish nation-state. This type of statement is often used by those who deny or downplay the historical connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel, thereby erasing the right to self-determination of Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, which is a fundamental component of antisemitic rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 1945: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any language or imagery that demonizes, dehumanizes, or stereotypes Jews.

      "Row 1946: [1]  This tweet can be considered antisemitic according to this definition (Answer: 1). The tweet accuses Israel of being a \"settler colonial racist, apartheid state,\" which is a comparison between the nation and apartheid. Additionally, it implies that people who support Jews should also support the mentioned negative aspects of Israel, implying that these individuals are hypocritical. This is harmful towards Jewish individuals as it portrays their community and political beliefs in an unfavorable light. Furthermore, the mention of \"nazi\" without any context could be perceived as a comparison between Jews who support Israel and the Nazis. This kind of statement reinforces old antisemitic tropes, suggesting that Jewish people are inherently connected to evil or oppressive regimes.\n",
      "Row 1947: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. The author is expressing concern about those who label synagogues as an enemy, which they consider violent Antisemitism. They reference a Biblical passage (\"synagogue of Satan\") often used in Jewish tradition to describe behavior contrary to Jewish values and ideals rather than attacking or demonizing Jews themselves. Thus, this tweet is not antisemitic, as it highlights a specific instance of Antisemitism and does not engage in the generalization of such views to all Jews.\n",
      "Row 1948: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or harm Jewish individuals or communities. It criticizes non-Jewish Germans from that specific historical period, highlighting the moral cowardice of those who remained silent during the Holocaust. The reference to Jews being gassed to death is a grim reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust. However, the tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or stereotypes about Jews as a group and instead focuses on the negative behavior of Germans who did nothing to stop genocide. So, despite its bleak context, it is not antisemitic in itself.\n",
      "Row 1949: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall into any of the categories of antisemitic expression as defined in the given text. It calls out another user for trying to explain the Holocaust to Jews with an intent to justify their own victim complex, which is not inherently an antisemitic action or sentiment. While it indirectly discusses a historical event involving persecution of Jews (the Holocaust), the focus of the tweet is on challenging someone's attempt to explain and use this historical tragedy for their benefit, rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or promoting any of the identified antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 1950: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or harm towards Jews or their property, institutions, or religious facilities. It also does not target Israel as a Jewish collectivity.

      "Row 1951: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or tropes, nor does it seem to call for harm against Jews. The user is referring to another account that got banned on another platform (Sean) for repeatedly claiming the Jews were responsible for 9/11. While this statement itself is incorrect and potentially offensive, the tweet is not accusing all Jews of anything, nor does it use stereotypical or demonizing language towards Jewish people. Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 1952: [1] 0. This tweet does not directly accuse Jews of anything negative, nor does it use any stereotypical or demonizing tropes about Jews.

      "Row 1953: [0]  Based on the provided definition and context, I would classify this tweet as 0 (not antisemitic). The tweet calls out a reported comment for hate speech, and it addresses misinformed assumptions about Israel, its citizens, and Palestinian people.

      "Row 1954: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any signs of antisemitism. It acknowledges that Jewish people can belong to various races or ethnic backgrounds, and it does not engage in stereotyping, demonizing, or blaming Jews collectively for wrongdoings.

      "Row 1955: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic, as it highlights a societal issue where Jews still face racism today and criticizes this treatment as unacceptable. The tweet does not use any stereotypical or dehumanizing language typically associated with antisemitism. Instead, it demonstrates an understanding of the hierarchy in racist behavior and acknowledges that skin color often takes precedence over other forms of discrimination.\n",
      "Row 1956: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the definition provided. The user is discussing how Jews were perceived as having white privilege in the 2000s and critiquing that perception, rather than making accusations or stereotyping about Jews themselves. While there might be some negative language used towards \"white people\" (a broader category), it does not specifically target Jewish individuals with antisemitic tropes or rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 1957: [0] 0. This tweet is questioning why some Jewish-Americans continue to support politicians who have been accused of antisemitism or have faced controversy regarding their stance on Israel, rather than being inherently antisemitic itself.

      "Row 1958: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or rhetoric, nor does it exhibit hatred towards Jews.

Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1979: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit into the definition of antisemitism provided, as it criticizes the lack of empathy towards a Jewish politician receiving death threats due to her religion and highlights hypocrisy in reactions toward different minority politicians. The criticism is directed at the inconsistency in how certain minority politicians are treated compared to others, rather than being an instance of antisemitism itself.\n",
      "Row 1980: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. While it might be seen as a joke or light-hearted commentary on the Jewish diaspora, it does not exhibit any of the characteristics of antisemitism outlined in the definition. It avoids dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews collectively, and does not attempt to blame Jews for \"why things go wrong\". Therefore, despite being a play on words, it is not an instance of antisemitism according to the given definitions.\n",
      "Row 1981: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition, as it criticizes specific beliefs within Islam rather than targeting Jews or Jewish individuals directly. The content of the message centers around a critique of certain Islamic teachings regarding Christians and polytheists. While such teachings may be perceived negatively by some readers, they do not inherently express hatred toward Jews or Judaism, nor do they accuse Jews of any wrongdoing or make generalizations about Jewish people.

      "Row 1982: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The author suggests that Jews have \"more claim upon Syria and Iraq than Arabs,\" implying a sense of superiority over Arab peoples, which can be seen as dehumanizing or demonizing towards them.\n",
      "2. The phrase \"but nobody gives a shit about our special feelings and connection\" implies that the claims made by the author should be taken seriously because they are Jewish. This suggests an entitlement to prioritize their interests over others, even though no historical, legal, or moral basis for this claim is provided.\n",
      "3. The statement \"The buck stops in Israel\" implies a sense of collective guilt or responsibility for the actions and decisions made by the Israeli government on all Jews globally, which is an antisemitic trope. This argument also ignores the fact that Israel is a democratic nation where decisions are made through its political processes and not through any inherent \"Jewish\" authority.\n",
      "4. The inclusion of numerous other Twitter users who have expressed their support for various pro-Palestinian or anti-Zionist positions might be seen as an effort to amplify these sentiments, thus perpetuating a narrative that is often steeped in antisemitism.\n",
      "  \n",
      "In conclusion, this tweet can be considered antisemitic because it promotes ideas that dehumanize, demonize or stereotype both Jews and Arabs, while also suggesting a sense of collective guilt for all Jews based on the actions of one nation's government, namely Israel.\n",
      "Row 1983: [0] 0. The tweet does not display any antisemitic content or intent, as it is a light-hearted comment on enjoying a Hanukkah-themed fan fiction and sharing laughter with other Jewish people who might understand its humor.

Therefore, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 1985: [0] 0. The tweet does not appear to directly target or demonize Jewish individuals or institutions, and instead refers to historical events during the Arab-Israeli conflict.

It implies that the removal of Jews from around the world to Israel is a significant factor in global events, such as a potential World War 3. This statement suggests a collective blame on all Jews for unrelated events and might encourage stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. The tweet may not directly use hateful language, but it promotes harmful narratives and conspiracy theories that can lead to antisemitic attitudes.\n",

The user accuses another person, @georgesoros, of \"killing all those evil Jews,\" which is a reference to the Holocaust and its victims. This statement blames an individual for a historical event that affected millions of Jewish people, thus employing antisemitic tropes. Additionally, it references the rise of antisemitism in Germany during the 1930s, further alluding to negative stereotypes associated with Jews.

This statement criticizes an action (claiming that Jews are disloyal) and highlights its similarity to a notorious antisemitic practice from history, without endorsing or perpetuating it.

      "Row 1990: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, because it calls out and clarifies a misconception about antisemitism being primarily related to religion. It states that antisemitism isn't restricted only to religious Jews, but secular Jews are also targets of antisemitism.

      "Row 1992: [0]  0. This tweet does not meet any of the criteria for antisemitism as listed in the provided definition. The user is expressing an opinion about a particular group within Judaism (liberal Jews), but they are not targeting or demonizing Jewish people or the Jewish community as a whole. Furthermore, the term \"self-hating\" is often used to describe individuals who may be critical of Israel or their own culture, which does not necessarily equate to antisemitism.

      "Row 1994: [0] 1. This tweet suggests that the person being referred to would have acted negatively towards Jews, specifically by putting them on trains (a reference to the Holocaust during which Jews were put in concentration camps and transported via trains). Such a statement implies that the group being referenced is comparable to the Nazis, who committed genocide against Jews. Therefore, it can be considered antisemitic as it accuses this group of behaving like those responsible for one of the worst acts of persecution in history towards Jewish people. This comparison is not only dehumanizing but also highly offensive and falls under the 12th point of your definition.\n",
      "Row 1995: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic in itself. It is challenging a potential viewpoint, which denies or minimizes the Holocaust and the atrocities committed against Jewish people during World War II.

      "Row 1996: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it targets a specific Jewish community and perpetuates stereotypes about their loyalty towards Israel and their propensity for violence against Jews. The reference to \"killing Jews\" is a direct link to age-old antisemitic tropes of Jews being inherently violent and malevolent, which can be seen as demonizing and dehumanizing Jews. The statement \"The girl & her family will be able to get good jobs with the PA now they've proved their willingness to kill Jews.\" is also targeting a specific group (the family of the girl) for their perceived actions against Jews, thus further reinforcing the antisemitic nature of the tweet.\n",

In addition, the use of this term alongside the phrase \"worst thing about kikes,\" and followed by a colon (\":\") suggests the author is about to elaborate on something negative or harmful about Jews, making it an antisemitic statement.

Moreover, it seems to express disdain for the Jewish people by referring to them with such a vile term. The statement \"The media's slanted view of kikes feasibly is the unfortunate result of back-stabbing!\" further implies that Jews are somehow manipulating the media to their advantage.

      "Row 2096: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided. It uses the pejorative term \"kikes\" and suggests that they look bad due to aesthetics, which is a negative stereotype about Jewish people. The use of \"alternative facts\" also implies that the user's statement is true despite evidence to the contrary. This further demonstrates an attempt to spread misinformation and dehumanize Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 2097: [0]  The given tweet is indeed antisemitic (1). It uses the derogatory terms \"Joooos\" and \"kikes,\" both of which are dehumanizing and demonizing slurs targeting Jews.

Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet should be classified as an instance of antisemitism (1).\n",
      "Row 2099: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it uses the pejorative term \"kikes\" to refer to Jews, which is a slur that targets Jewish people. Additionally, it makes generalized and stereotypical claims about Jews without providing any evidence or context, such as blaming them for the Syrian crisis solely due to their socialist beliefs. This is a clear instance of demonizing and dehumanizing Jews by attributing blame to them without justification. The presence of a hashtag (#Syria) that does not directly relate to antisemitism further solidifies the assumption that the tweet is indeed antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2100: [1]  This tweet is classified as (1) antisemitic. The language used in the tweet, such as \"kikes,\" is a pejorative term directed toward Jews and carries an undertone of hatred. Additionally, the phrase \"one-sided view\" could refer to antisemitic narratives that are selectively amplified or given more prominence than they deserve. Thus, the use of these terms in combination with the context of a discussion about media bias indicates antisemitic intent on behalf of the user.\n",
      "Row 2101: [0] This tweet can be considered antisemitic. The term \"kike\" is an extremely offensive and derogatory slur used specifically against Jewish people, and using it to describe a person or situation is a clear example of antisemitism. The reasoning behind this classification is based on the definition provided, which considers using dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective, to be one form of antisemitism. In this case, the tweet uses a slur that targets Jews specifically and is therefore classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2102: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements. First, it uses the derogatory term \"kikes\" as part of a list that includes other discriminatory slurs (fags and trannys). The word \"kike\" is widely recognized as an antisemitic slur. Second, the tweet suggests that America is burning due to \"the media,\" which could imply that the author believes Jews, who are often associated with the media, are responsible for the current state of the country. This echoes traditional antisemitic tropes that blame Jews for societal problems. Finally, the mention of \"Groypin\" refers to a white nationalist meme-based movement known for its antisemitism and promotion of far-right ideologies. The author's inclusion of Groypin in their tweet demonstrates support for this hateful movement. Therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements and should be classified as 1.\n",
      "Row 2103: [0] 1. The presence of the term \"Kikes\" in this tweet indicates that it is antisemitic, as defined.

It also links Jews with \"evidence of the socialist revolution,\" which can be seen as promoting a negative or harmful stereotype about Jewish people. The use of derogatory language and the association of Jews with an ideology is in line with antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 2105: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user is stating a personal opinion, referencing the term \"kikes,\" and questioning its origins, specifically connecting it with socialist revolution.

      "Row 2108: [0] 0. This tweet is not directly antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not contain any explicit language or tropes targeting Jews or Israel. The tweet seems to be critical of a person's (Will) actions in calling out individuals who use antisemitic language while also mentioning their association with another individual or podcast. While it refers to the topic of antisemitism, the focus is on criticizing an individual's actions and motives rather than perpetuating antisemitic ideas.\n",
      "Row 2109: [0] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic language, specifically the use of the term \"kikes.\" According to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet should be classified as antisemitic because it uses dehumanizing and demonizing language targeted at Jewish individuals or their property (in this case, by referring to them as \"kikes\").

      "Row 2112: [1] 1. Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic due to the use of a derogatory term \"kikes\" directed towards Jewish individuals.

The additional laughter emoticons further emphasize that the user is unapologetically using this hateful language.\n",
      "Row 2113: [1]  1. This tweet contains several elements that can be considered antisemitic. The use of the term \"kikes\" is a dehumanizing, demonizing, and stereotypical allegation about Jews as a collective, which falls under point 4 in the definition provided. Additionally, accusing Israel of state-sponsored terror attacks against Palestinians with no substantial evidence can be viewed as an attempt to tarnish Israel's reputation by falsely attributing wrongful actions to it - this could align with antisemitic behavior directed towards the Jewish nation and its modern-day state.\n",
      "Row 2114: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided because it uses derogatory slurs such as \"kikes\" which are a clear form of hatred toward Jews, targeting them with hateful language.

      "Row 2116: [1]  1. The tweet \"Hell to all those Zionazis\" contains an antisemitic term, \"Zionazi\". This term combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\", which is used to demonize and attack Jews and their beliefs in a similar manner as the Nazi regime did. As per the definition of antisemitism, such dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective constitute an expression of hatred toward Jews. Thus, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2117: [1] 1. The term \"zionazi\" itself contains elements from both antisemitism (Zionist) and racism (Nazi), both used to attack Jewish individuals and Israel unfairly. Combining the two terms in this way is a clear attempt at demonizing and dehumanizing Jews, and therefore qualifies as an antisemitic statement under the provided definition. This tweet could reasonably be interpreted as encouraging violence against Jewish people based on their perceived political beliefs, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism that includes targeting individuals or institutions because of their Jewishness or for being perceived as 'Zionist'.\n",
      "Row 2118: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided because it uses an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\") and accuses Jewish or Israeli individuals of committing atrocities and crimes against defenceless people, which is a negative stereotype about Jews or Israelis. This type of rhetoric can incite hatred towards Jewish or non-Jewish individuals who support or are part of the Israeli government or community. The term \"zionazi\" itself combines two historically oppressive groups (Nazis and Zionists), implying that they are morally equivalent, which is a false and damaging comparison.\n",
      "Row 2119: [1] 0. Although the term \"toxic zionazi\" used in this tweet is an antisemitic term, it is being applied to another person (Rachel Riley) and not directly at Jewish people or the community in general.

As such, according to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it's not promoting hatred towards Jews or attacking them collectively. The context given seems to be the user expressing disagreement with Rachel Riley's views rather than expressing hate or bigotry against Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 2120: [1] 1. The usage of the term \"Zionazi\" in this tweet is antisemitic because it combines two negative concepts (\"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\") to target someone who supports or identifies with Israel, which can be perceived as an attack on Jewish people collectively. Although this tweet could also be interpreted as a criticism of individuals who conflate Zionism with Nazism, the use of such a derogatory term is likely meant to incite hatred and animosity towards Jews or those who support Israel, making it antisemitic according to your definition.\n",
      "Row 2121: [1]  Based on the definition of antisemitism provided, this particular tweet should be classified as antisemitic (1). The term \"Zionazi\" is a combination of 'Zionist' and 'Nazi,' both of which are laden with negative connotations.

      "Row 2123: [1] 0. This tweet is criticizing others for labeling someone as \"zionazi\" rather than the person being labeled or attacked in a negative way. While the term \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur, the context of the tweet is not used to demonize Jews or propagate antisemitism. The author of this tweet is expressing annoyance towards people who unfairly use this label, which doesn't qualify it as a text promoting or containing antisemitic sentiments.\n",
      "Row 2124: [1] 1. The term \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur that conflates Nazism and Zionism, which can be considered a form of Holocaust denial or minimization. Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic because it uses such a term to characterize Israel settlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 2125: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it uses the term \"zionazi\" which is a derogatory term combining the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It is an example of antisemitism since it associates Jews with Nazi ideology, stereotypically vilifying them. This term aims to dehumanize and demonize individuals who support Israel or identify as Jewish, which aligns with several points in the provided definition of antisemitism, such as making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews (Point 4) or blaming Jews for “why things go wrong” (Point 2).\n",

This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism, as it uses the term \"Zionazi\" which is a fusion of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" both carrying negative connotations. This phrase is commonly used as an antisemitic insult that accuses Jews collectively of being like Nazis or perpetuating Nazi-like actions. The term also associates Israel with terrorism, further fueling antisemitic sentiment and stereotypes about the Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 2128: [1] 1. The tweet refers to individuals as \"White Supremacist Zionazi Christians and Jews,\" which combines two distinct groups (white supremacists and Zionists) into a single term, implying that all Christians and Jews are white supremacists and supports the antisemitic idea of collectively blaming Jews for issues or problems.

      "Row 2129: [1] 1. The tweet uses the term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is an example of antisemitism, as it equates Jews or Jewish political ideologies with Nazism. This conflation aims to demonize and dehumanize those associated with Zionism or Judaism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this specific instance, the tweet targets two individuals who are affiliated with UKIP (United Kingdom Independence Party).

Such accusations spread hatred towards Jews and Jewish state of Israel, which are considered antisemitic tropes by modern definitions. Additionally, it claims that Zionists believe in an \"innate belief superiority,\" perpetuating the stereotype that Jews consider themselves superior to others. This tweet falls into several categories defined as antisemitism: 3 (calling for or justifying harm against Jews), and 9 (denying Jewish people's right to self-determination). It also utilizes a comparison between Zionism and fascism, which is similar to category 10 (applying double standards to Israel that are not demanded of any other nation).\n",
      "Row 2131: [1] 1. The use of \"neo-nazi\" and \"Zionazi\" in the tweet is clearly intended to conflate Jewish people with Nazi ideology, which fits the definition of antisemitism as it equates Jews or Israel with Nazism. Additionally, \"Zionazi\" specifically combines two derogatory terms: Zionist, a person who believes in the establishment of a nation-state of Israel, and Nazi, referring to a follower of the fascist movement led by Adolf Hitler during World War II. By combining these terms, the intent is to demonize both Jews and the concept of a Jewish homeland (Israel). Therefore, according to the definition of antisemitism you provided, this tweet can be considered as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2132: [0] 0. The tweet does not target Jews or the Jewish community with hatred or harmful actions. Instead, it calls out an individual (Ruth Smeeth) who is being called a \"zionazi.\" While \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, in this context, it is used to point out the problematic behavior of others, rather than promoting hate or harm towards Jews. Therefore, the tweet itself is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2133: [1]  0. The tweet does not display hatred toward Jews or express antisemitic sentiments directly. Instead, it is using the term \"Zionazi\" to call out someone's behavior or opinion they disagree with, and it doesn't target Jews collectively as an entire group in a dehumanizing manner. This use of \"Zionazi\" does not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 2134: [1]  1. According to the definition provided, the tweet can be considered antisemitic as it equates \"Zionazis\" with other oppressive groups and uses an antisemitic term (\"zionazi\") that associates Zionism or Judaism with Nazism, a form of hatred towards Jews. While the context may not explicitly target Jews in a harmful way, the tweet's comparison to hateful groups like the KKK and ISIS suggests a prejudiced view towards people affiliated with Israel or Jewish beliefs.

It uses the term \"Zionazi,\" which is a combination of \"Zionist\" and the derogatory slur \"Nazi.\" This term is often used to vilify Jewish people or those who support Israel, and it reflects a common antisemitic stereotype that links Zionists with Nazis.

While it criticizes Mr. Giuliani's actions and accusations, it still employs an antisemitic term and therefore should be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2138: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic for two main reasons, as it utilizes both the term \"ZioNazi\" and refers to a connection with \"Tel Aviv.\" The term \"ZioNazi\" is a fusion of the terms \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" which historically has been used as an antisemitic slur that connects Jews or Israel with Nazism. Additionally, referring to someone doing \"the bidding of Tel Aviv\" can be seen as dehumanizing and stereotypical, implying that this person is acting on behalf of a collective Jewish entity rather than as an individual.\n",
      "Row 2139: [1] 1. The use of \"Zionazi\" in this tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it is an amalgamation of the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term combines the word \"Zionist,\" which relates to the state of Israel and its supporters, with a slur often used against Jews.

      "Row 2140: [1] 1. The use of the term \"zioNazi\" in this tweet is an antisemitic trope, as it combines two historically oppressive ideologies (antisemitism and Nazism) to attack Jewish individuals or Israel.

In this context, the term is being used to criticize a Daily Mail article about an alleged \"zioNazi\" attack, which further perpetuates the antisemitic stereotype of Jewish people having collective power and responsibility for the actions of the state of Israel or other individuals who identify as Jewish.

Additionally, it accuses Jews with dual citizenship (in this case, Israel) of committing violence against Palestinian babies, furthering the trope that Jews are inherently violent and responsible for the suffering of others.

The use of the term \"zionazi,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is an antisemitic slur that equates Zionists, who support the existence of a Jewish state in Israel, with Nazis.

      "Row 2145: [1]  1. The tweet refers to an individual as a \"Zionazi,\" which is a term that combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is antisemitic because it implies a false equivalence between Jews (or Zionists) and Nazis.

Additionally, the tweet accuses Israeli \"zionazi snipers\" (who are likely Jewish) of acting immorally without contextualizing their actions within a broader conflict between Israel and Palestine. This could lead to the perception that Jews or Israel as a collective entity are responsible for these actions, which falls into the pattern of blaming all Jews for the actions of a few or a nation state, one of the antisemitic tropes mentioned in the definition.\n",

It goes on to accuse Israel of being responsible for 9/11, a baseless conspiracy theory that has no factual basis, but is often propagated as antisemitic propaganda. The tweet's portrayal of Israel as a \"rogue,\" \"violent,\" and \"aggressive\" entity is also antisemitic in nature.\n",
      "3. The statement \"and its ZioNazi amen corner are threatening world peace due to its overwhelming desire for regional and global hegemony.\" not only refers to Mark Levin again with the antisemitic slur, but it also implies that a 'Zionist lobby' or Jewish individuals are controlling international affairs.\n",

      "Row 2152: [1]  1. The given tweet can be considered antisemitic based on the definition provided. It contains several elements of antisemitism, such as:\n",
      "   - Using a derogatory term \"zionazis\" to refer to Israel and its supporters. This term is a combination of the words \"Zionist\" (referring to Jews who support the state of Israel) and \"Nazi\" (a member or supporter of the National Socialist Party of Germany, which was responsible for the Holocaust).\n",
      "   - Accusing \"zionazis\" as terrorists. This stereotype is often used against Jews and is a form of antisemitism.\n",
      "  \n",

      "   - It uses the term \"ZioNazis\", which combines two antisemitic terms, \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\". The combination of these two words is a clear indicator of antisemitism as it demonizes Jewish people by associating them with Nazi ideology. \n",

      "Row 2154: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements, such as using the term \"ZioNazi\" and mentioning \"Luciferians.\" These terms are frequently used in antisemitic contexts to demonize and spread hatred towards Jewish people. Additionally, referring to Jews collectively with these labels is a prime example of accusations against Jewish citizens of being loyal only to Israel or Jews worldwide (as per the provided definition of antisemitism). Therefore, according to this definition, I would classify this tweet as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2155: [1] 0. Although this tweet contains the term \"Zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur, it does not target or demonize Jews but rather addresses someone who is accused of being controlled by a Zionist narrative. In this context, the use of \"Zionazi\" is not employed to attack or vilify Jews, but as a criticism against one individual's actions. Consequently, while the term itself is antisemitic, the tweet isn't classified as antisemitic when considering its intent and context.\n",
      "Row 2156: [1] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes, but rather calls out the \"deception, lies, and spin\" of Zionists as being exposed in court. The term \"zionazi\" is used to refer to those supporting Zionism, which can be considered a negative term. However, it does not demonize or dehumanize Jewish people nor accuse them collectively for the actions of Israel. Instead, it criticizes their arguments and statements in a legal context, making it more of a criticism towards their point of view rather than an attack against Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 2157: [1]  1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the provided definition because it contains a comparison between Nazis and \"Zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic term, and accuses them of invasions, dispossessing people, and crimes against humanity. The use of this term to characterize Israel and its policies contributes to negative stereotypes about Jews and Israel, thus it is classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2158: [1] 0. Although the tweet contains some terms (like \"ZioNazi\") that may be perceived as negative and antisemitic, it is criticizing what it refers to as the \"war crimes\" of a government, rather than targeting Jewish people or individuals of Jewish faith. The criticism here is directed towards Israel's actions and policies, not towards Jews in general. As such, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2159: [1] 1. The tweet contains a reference to \"ZioNazis,\" which is an antisemitic term. This phrase combines two historically oppressive groups (Zionists and Nazis) into one term, intending to smear and dehumanize Jews.\n",

      "2. By using the term \"Saudi friends,\" it implies a connection between Jews (or Israelis, as \"ZioNazis\" implies) and Saudi Arabia.

      "Taking these factors into account, I would classify this tweet as 1 (antisemitic). While it's important to note that not every criticism of Israel or Jewish people is inherently antisemitic, the use of \"ZioNazi\" and its implications about a secret alliance with Saudi Arabia are clear indicators of antisemitism in this tweet.\n",
      "Row 2160: [1] 1. According to the definition provided, this tweet could be considered antisemitic. The term \"ZioNazi\" combines two antisemitic tropes: Nazis (a historical group responsible for the Holocaust and other atrocities) and Zionists/Jews. This slur is often used to demonize Jews by associating them with the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. Therefore, it can be classified as antisemitic based on the definition provided.\n",

      "   \n",
      "   b) The claim that these armed thugs have been \"shooting school children for the past 30 years\" is an attempt to blame Jews or Israelis for violent actions, further stoking hatred and anti-Jewish sentiment.\n",

It meets several criteria in the list of examples given under antisemitism: it dehumanizes or demonizes Jews (point 4), blames Jews for wrongdoings (point 5), and uses classic antisemitism to characterize Israel or Jews (point 9).\n",
      "Row 2162: [1] 0. The term \"Zionazis\" appears to be an amalgamation of \"zionist\" and \"nazi.\" It is used by the author as a derogatory nickname towards those who are accused of being both Zionists and Nazis. Although \"Nazi\" carries strong negative connotations due to its association with one of history's most horrific regimes, this tweet does not express hatred or violence towards Jewish individuals or their property. Rather, it serves as a criticism against the mentioned individuals by calling them \"Zionazis.\" In this context, while the term itself carries antisemitic implications, it is used to criticize the people referred to in the tweet and not to further any anti-Semitic agenda, making it not inherently antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2163: [1] 1. The tweet references \"Rachael\" as a \"zionazi,\" which contains an antisemitic term, \"zionazi.\" While it does not directly target the Jewish people as a whole, the term is used to stereotype and demonize an individual, and can be seen as an attack on a person based on their perceived political beliefs or affiliations with Israel. As per the definition provided, using such terms to characterize individuals is considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2164: [1]  Based on the given definition of antisemitism and provided examples, the tweet: \"@aliciavperry They remind of what I read about what happened to Jews in Europe. Now those zionazis are doing the same thing to those innocent Palestinians.\" can be classified as 1 (antisemitic). This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements. Firstly, it falsely equates \"zionazi\" with \"Jews,\" which is a derogatory term used to demonize and dehumanize Jewish people. Secondly, the tweet implies that Israeli actions towards Palestinians mirror the atrocities committed against Jews during the Holocaust. This comparison tarnishes the memory of those who suffered in the Holocaust by comparing it to a political conflict. Furthermore, it accuses Jews or Israel of oppressing Palestinians without providing any evidence, further contributing to its antisemitic nature.\n",
      "Row 2165: [1] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior, as it is using the term \"Zionazi\" to poke fun at Donald Trump's perceived hypocrisy rather than to attack or demonize Jewish people. It is critical of Trump and his inconsistency in terms of immigration policies, which can be seen through references to building a wall and other political issues. While \"Zionazi\" might have antisemitic connotations, its usage here is not in line with the definition of antisemitism provided earlier. The tweet's main intent appears to mock Trump's perceived inconsistencies rather than targeting Jewish people or Israel, which is why it should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2166: [1] 0. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet does not exhibit any characteristic that falls under the category of antisemitism. The content seems to be a statement regarding the temporary unavailability of a Twitter account due to violating the Twitter Media Policy, rather than an expression of hatred towards Jews or any other antisemitic tropes. Therefore, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic according to our definition.\n",
      "Row 2167: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic based on the definition provided, primarily because it uses the term \"ZioNazi\" which is a fusion of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is used to demonize Jews or Israel by accusing them of being like Nazis or perpetrating Nazi-like actions. While the tweet does not directly attack or harm any individuals, it still promotes an antisemitic sentiment by suggesting that the think tank and its leader are malicious and responsible for Iranians dying due to sanctions. This usage of the term \"ZioNazi\" is a clear manifestation of antisemitism and thus, the answer is 1.\n",
      "Row 2168: [0] 0. Although the tweet criticizes the term \"zionazi,\" it does not promote or express hatred toward Jews or Israel. It specifically calls out the use of a racist slur and compares it to how other far-right groups disguise their antisemitism, showing that the author understands its negative implications. While the term itself is antisemitic, this tweet is not promoting or endorsing such ideas, but rather criticizing those who do.\n",
      "Row 2169: [1]  This tweet does not seem to be explicitly antisemitic, but it could be interpreted as such due to its language. It criticizes those who support human rights for Palestinians by calling them \"Anti-semite\" and associating the term with \"colonial Zionazi fascists.\" While it doesn't directly blame Jews or Israel for wrongdoings or make dehumanizing statements, it uses some antisemitic language (e.g., \"Zionazi\") to criticize those who support human rights for Palestinians, which could potentially fuel hatred towards Jewish people in the context of this conflict.\n",

      "However, considering the fact that the tweet is critiquing a specific group's viewpoint and not making an overall statement about Jewish people or Israel, it can be argued that it falls more on the side of criticism rather than promoting antisemitic ideas.

It is essential to take into consideration the context and intent behind the language used in a tweet when evaluating whether it promotes or encourages antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2170: [1] 1. The tweet uses the term \"Zionazis,\" which combines two words - \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This is an antisemitic slur that associates Jews with Nazis, a notorious hate group responsible for the Holocaust.

      "Row 2171: [1] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic language, specifically the term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" with a slur referring to Nazi Germany and its genocidal regime. This combination implies that Jewish people or Israel are being compared to Nazis, which falls under the definition of antisemitism. It also calls individuals \"criminal zionazis,\" further stigmatizing Jews and implying they are collectively responsible for negative actions, another characteristic of antisemitic behavior.

      "- Linking to the Holocaust: The tweet claims that the Holocaust started through similar propaganda, further implying a comparison between the current situation and the historical atrocities committed against Jews during World War II.

However, upon closer examination, this particular tweet does not explicitly target or harm Jewish individuals or their property. Instead, the term \"Zionazi induced dementia\" seems to refer to a group of people (Warmongers, Neocrazies, or Likudnicks) rather than directly referring to Jews themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is essential to consider that the terms used in this tweet - \"Zionazi,\" \"Warmongers,\" and \"Neocrazies\" - do have a potential association with antisemitic tropes.

      "Considering the given definition, this tweet does not meet all the criteria for a definitive classification of it as antisemitic. It contains elements that could potentially be perceived as antisemitic; however, without further context and knowing the intention behind the author's message, it is challenging to label this specific instance as unequivocally antisemitic.\n",
      "\n",

      "Row 2174: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic due to the use of the term \"ZioNazi\" in reference to the Trump regime. The term is an amalgamation of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" both of which have negative connotations historically associated with Judaism and Nazism, respectively. It wrongly implies that President Trump or his administration is driven by a malicious intent towards Jews due to their perceived support for Israel. Additionally, the tweet stereotypically suggests that the Trump regime only focuses on certain groups (such as \"antifa\" and \"Muslims\") while ignoring others, further perpetuating harmful generalizations about Jewish involvement in government affairs.\n",
      "Row 2175: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements: it invokes the term \"ZioNazis,\" which combines Nazi with the Jewish state, Israel, implying a connection between Jews and Nazism that is false and malicious; it also refers to concentration camps, internment, and mental asylums in the context of Israel, which invokes historical traumas experienced by Jews. These aspects are all antisemitic according to the definition provided. The author's use of \"Zio\" as a prefix for \"Zombie\" is another example of antisemitism, employing a slur directed at Jewish people. Thus, this tweet is clearly antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2176: [1] 0. Although \"zionazi\" can be considered an antisemitic term, it is not being used in this tweet to attack or demonize Jews but rather to criticize the usage of a particular word.

This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it uses the term \"Zionazism,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" The combination of these terms is intended to associate Israel and its supporters with Nazis and their genocidal actions against Jewish people during World War II.

      "Row 2179: [1] 1. This tweet appears to be antisemitic based on the provided definition, as it contains a number of elements that are commonly associated with antisemitic rhetoric: the use of the term \"ZioNazi\" and the blame placed on \"imperial England\". While the user does not explicitly criticize or demonize Jews themselves, the combination of these two tropes indicates an underlying antisemitic sentiment. The term \"ZioNazi\", for example, is a fusion of \"Zionism\" and \"Nazis\", often used to associate Zionism and the state of Israel with the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during World War II. This comparison can be deeply offensive and hurtful to Jewish people, as it trivializes and equates their historical suffering with those of a different group. Similarly, accusing England (which is not mentioned in this tweet) of being responsible for \"the problem\" implies that the user believes Jews are not the true proprietors of Israel, but rather puppets or subjects of another, more powerful entity. This line of thinking can reinforce anti-Jewish stereotypes and further marginalize Jewish people by suggesting they lack autonomy over their own nation state.\n",
      "Row 2180: [1] 1. The phrase \"zionazis\" in this context can be considered antisemitic as it combines two offensive terms (\"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\") to demonize Jews or Israel, which is a violation of the definition you've provided about what constitutes antisemitism. Even though the intention behind this tweet might not necessarily be to directly harm Jews or incite hatred against them, the combination of these two terms creates an image linking Jewish people with historical atrocities and prejudices, which is why it qualifies as a form of antisemitic expression according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2181: [1] 0. Although this tweet contains negative language, it is not specifically targeting Jews or Israelis with antisemitic tropes. It is critical of a specific politician's (Joseph Biden) actions but does not apply any stereotypes or prejudices typically associated with antisemitism to the politician in question. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2182: [1]  Based on the definition provided and the context of this specific tweet, I would classify it as an antisemitic tweet (1). Here's my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"zionazist\" is a clear combination of the words \"Zionism\" and \"Nazi.\" The use of this term implies that the author is likening Zionists, who are often Jews or supporters of Israel, to Nazis. This not only dehumanizes and demonizes Jewish individuals but also associates them with one of history's most heinous regimes responsible for genocide and mass extermination. This tweet falls under the category of using \"classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel,\" as mentioned in your definition.\n",
      "Row 2183: [1] 1. The tweet contains two antisemitic elements: the use of the term \"ZioNazi\" and the assertion that British people should not fall for \"zionist shit.\" These phrases demonstrate hatred towards Jews, and therefore, according to the provided definition of antisemitism, this tweet is classified as 1.\n",
      "Row 2184: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly use antisemitic tropes or language but rather criticizes the Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, and the concept of \"Greater Israel.\" Although it could be seen as an exaggeration or insult towards a political figure, it is not expressing hatred toward Jews or any other group. Therefore, based on the provided definition of antisemitism and the examples given, this tweet can be classified as not being antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2185: [1] 1. The tweet in question includes an antisemitic slur, \"zionazi.\" This term combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" which are used to associate Jewish people and their supporters with Nazism, a hateful and historically dangerous belief system. In this context, the use of the word \"unbelievable\" further emphasizes the tweet's disdain or disgust towards Jews, as it highlights that the author finds it difficult to believe someone could be a Zionist. This sentiment reflects one of the definitions of antisemitism that involves \"charging Jews with conspiring to harm humanity.\" Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2186: [1]  Based on the definition provided and your examples, this tweet can be considered antisemitic. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" in reference to FDD (Foundation for Defense of Democracies) is a clear example of antisemitism as it combines two derogatory terms (\"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\") to denigrate Jews and their organizations.\n",
      "2. Claiming that the organization should not be taken seriously due to its Jewish influence demonstrates a bias against Jewish individuals or institutions, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "3. Calling Dubowitz (MDubowitz) a \"B1TCH\" who likely has personal issues and takes out his hatred towards ordinary Iranians is not explicitly targeting him due to his Jewish identity. However, as an individual associated with a Jewish organization, it could still be seen as an indirect attack on him as a Jew.\n",

      "So, the answer would be 1 (antisemitic) based on the provided definition and examples.\n",
      "Row 2187: [1]  1. This tweet uses the term \"Zionazi,\" which is a combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" The term \"Zionazi\" is antisemitic because it conflates Jews with Nazis, one of history's most notorious hate groups responsible for the Holocaust. This association is a classic form of antisemitism (as defined in the reference materials provided) that aims to demonize and dehumanize Jewish people. The user also refers to Yascha as \"Munich born Polock,\" which could be interpreted as an attempt to question his legitimacy or belonging due to ethnicity, which is another form of antisemitism. Additionally, the tweet further accuses him of being a tool for \"the establishment\" and part of a larger conspiracy involving \"neoliberal propaganda.\" This conspiratorial framing could be interpreted as promoting the age-old idea that Jews control or manipulate various social, political, and economic aspects for their advantage. Therefore, based on the provided definition, this tweet would likely be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2188: [1] 1. This tweet contains a combination of elements that can be classified as antisemitic: it uses the term \"JEWISH\" in an aggressive and derogatory manner, refers to the user as \"fat,\" and uses the term \"zionazi.\" The term \"zionazi\" is a slur that combines the words \"Zionist\" (which relates to support for Israel) with \"Nazi.\" While the tweet is not directly targeting Jews or Judaism, it does use language that is commonly associated with antisemitism. Furthermore, it suggests that being called an \"antisemite\" is a negative and undesirable label, which in itself can be seen as a form of denial of antisemitism. Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 2190: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains the term \"zionazi\", which is an antisemitic slur combining the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\". The tweet also calls for expelling all Zionists from Palestine, which can be seen as a threat towards Jewish individuals or institutions in the region. This aligns with the definition of antisemitism mentioned earlier, as it demonstrates hatred towards Jews and seeks to harm Jewish people or their properties through targeting them collectively.\n",
      "Row 2191: [1]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic. It appears to be playful and critical of the term \"Zionazi\" and its usage by the user @YourFriendZippy, rather than an expression of hate or bigotry towards Jews or Israel. The tweet does not target Jewish individuals or institutions with hatred nor does it involve manifestations of antisemitism defined in the provided list. It also doesn't contain any rhetorical tropes associated with antisemitism, such as blaming Jews for wrongdoing or comparing them to Nazis.\n",
      "Row 2192: [0] 0. The tweet cites an antisemitic remark (\"Zionazi\") and calls it out as \"typical anti-Semitic garbage\".

It accuses Israel of being a \"ZioNazi regime\" and implies that the entire nation is engaged in \"ethnic cleansing.\" Furthermore, it claims that there are no world leaders condemning this alleged crime against humanity, implying that Jewish people are beyond reproach or accountability due to their collective identity. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes and false narratives about Jews and Israel, which is why this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2194: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language or expression and is instead highlighting the contradictions in how some people perceive both Israel's right to exist as a Jewish homeland and acknowledging Palestinian rights. The author of the tweet points out that they are being criticized for holding these two perspectives simultaneously, but neither viewpoint is inherently antisemitic on its own. They express support for both Jewish rights (the existence of Israel) and Palestinian rights, which does not fall under any of the criteria outlined in the provided definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2195: [0]  0. The tweet in question seems to be questioning the classification of \"zionazi\" as an antisemitic term, rather than using it as a slur against Jewish people. This tweet is not calling out Jews or Israel with hatred, and instead is trying to provoke discussion about the term's nature. Therefore, while \"zionazi\" is indeed an antisemitic term in many contexts, this specific tweet does not promote hatred towards Jews or use the term in a harmful way, hence it should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2196: [1] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic elements, specifically the use of \"zionazi\" as an insult, which is a combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is often used to demonize and attack Jewish people or those who support Israel.

      "Row 2198: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime (zionazi) and implies that the nation of Israel is guilty of \"extreme crimes.\" The use of the term \"zionazi\" combines \"Zionist\" with the slur \"Nazi,\" which is an antisemitic trope. Additionally, it calls out NATO/WEST for not condemning these alleged actions.\n",
      "Row 2199: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it uses the term \"Zionazi\" to refer to Israeli political figures and accuses them of terrorizing Palestinian people while claiming to be victims themselves. The use of \"Zionazi,\" a fusion of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" is a well-known antisemitic slur that combines two historically oppressed groups (Jews and the Nazis) into one insulting term. By using this term, the tweet promotes the idea that Israel, as the nation state of Jews, is equivalent to the oppressive regime of the Nazi party, which is a clear manifestation of antisemitism according to the definition provided. Additionally, the reference to \"Shiite\" seems to be used in a derogatory manner towards Muslims, further perpetuating stereotypes and hatred between religious groups.

The author refers to people as \"Zionazis,\" which is a clear reference to Nazism, but applied to Jewish people or those supportive of Israel. This comparison is problematic because it associates Zionists and Jews with one of history's worst genocidal regimes, thus dehumanizing them. Furthermore, the use of \"#FreePalestine\" and \"#BDS\" demonstrates a strong alignment with a political movement that often employs antisemitic language and rhetoric in their criticism of Israel. The BDS movement has been accused of using antisemitic tropes to undermine Israel's legitimacy as a nation-state, thus promoting an environment where antisemitism can thrive.\n",
      "Row 2204: [1]  1. This tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. It uses the term \"Zionazis\" which is a derogatory and antisemitic term, comparing Jews and Israelis to Nazis. Additionally, it dehumanizes Palestinians by implying that their lives are disposable, which supports a narrative of denying the humanity and rights of Palestinians. The tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and myths about Israel and its treatment of Palestinians, which can contribute to antisemitic beliefs and actions.\n",
      "Row 2205: [1] 0. While the tweet contains antisemitic language (referring to a group as \"zionazis\"), it does not express hatred or violence towards Jews or their institutions. Instead, it criticizes someone for being hypocritical and associating with people referred to as \"zionazis.\" The use of this term by itself might be considered antisemitic, but the overall context of the tweet is critical towards hypocrisy and not explicitly promoting hatred or violence against Jews.\n",
      "Row 2206: [1]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it refers to Rachel Riley, a British television presenter and journalist, with the term \"zionazi.\" The word \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur that combines \"Zionist,\" which has become synonymous with Jewish, and \"Nazi.\" Using this term to refer to a person, particularly in the context of a political disagreement or criticism, can be understood as hateful towards Jews.\n",
      "Row 2207: [1] 1. The tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements:\n",
      "   a) The use of the term \"Zionazi,\" which combines two historically oppressive terms, \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This is an example of a slur used to demonize and dehumanize Jewish people.\n",
      "   b) The claim that the U.S. government is enabling the Israeli government by recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and facilitating Noahide law. While it's important to critically examine geopolitical decisions, this tweet does so in a way that targets Jewish people rather than the governments involved.\n",
      "   c) The reference to \"Noahide laws\" and their alleged connection to the \"lucifarian/abrahamic prophecy\" is a conspiracy theory that has been used by antisemites to spread fear and hatred against Jews, falsely accusing them of trying to control society through law.\n",

      "Overall, this tweet contains multiple elements of antisemitism and can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2208: [1] 1. This tweet contains several antisemitic elements and can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition. The user employs a number of tropes, such as accusing supporters of Israel (those who are Jewish or not) of spreading \"hasbara BS,\" which is an antisemitic dog whistle for conspiracy theories about the influence of Jews on media narratives, and further uses slurs like \"zionazi\" to refer to Jews. The user also makes a direct comparison between Zionism and Satanism, using the phrase \"synagogue of satan,\" which is an antisemitic trope rooted in anti-Jewish hatred and conspiracy theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the tweet describes Israel's actions toward Palestine as \"evil\" and \"apartheid terrorism.\" This is another example of an antisemitic comparison between Israel and apartheid regimes, which delegitimizes the existence and rights of the Jewish state. It also calls for others to watch and condemn these perceived acts of terrorism, thus inciting hatred against Jews and Zionists.\n",
      "Row 2209: [1] 1. The tweet contains an antisemitic term, \"zionazi\", which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\". This term is used to demonize Jewish people and equate them with Nazis, which falls under the definition of antisemitism. While the author may be criticizing a specific group or individual's actions, the language they have chosen is explicitly antisemitic and serves to vilify Jews as a collective. Therefore, it should be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2210: [1] 0. While this tweet does include an antisemitic term \"zionazi,\" it is used to remember and condemn violence committed by a faction considered as terrorist by the author of the tweet, rather than demonizing or attacking Jews collectively. The term \"zionazi\" may be considered inflammatory and offensive, but in this context, the tweet does not promote hatred towards Jewish people. Instead, it seems to be referring specifically to violent actions committed by certain groups in Palestine, rather than a general attack on Jews or Israel. Therefore, according to the given definition of antisemitism, it can be considered not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2211: [1]  1. This tweet contains several antisemitic tropes, such as using \"Zionazi\" to refer to supporters of Israel and comparing them to cockroaches, which is a form of dehumanization. Additionally, it accuses the Israeli government of genocide, another common antisemitic stereotype. The tweet's overall tone and language can be seen as expressing hatred toward Jews and their collective power, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism provided. Thus, this tweet should be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2212: [1] 0. This tweet does not display antisemitism, as it calls out a term (\"zionazi\") that is itself an antisemitic slur, but the context of the tweet is not using this term to attack or demonize Jews or Israel. Instead, it is pointing out the absurdity of Iran being in a \"sick list\" related to \"Zionazis,\" implying the phrase's irrational and unjust nature. While it may reference a negative concept (zionazi), it is not using it as a means to perpetuate hate or prejudice against Jews or Israel, making it not antisemitic in this case.\n",
      "Row 2213: [1]  1. This tweet contains several antisemitic elements, such as the use of the term \"ZioNazi\" and implying that Jewish people or Israel are exempt from laws that apply to others (\"only apply to the goyim\"). These tropes fall under categories 3 (Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews) and 10 (Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation). Additionally, it targets a specific Jewish person (@Betelgeuse100) along with the entire community, which is also indicative of antisemitic rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 2214: [1] 1. This tweet includes multiple antisemitic elements: the use of \"Zionazi\" as a slur, comparing it to the \"Trumpidiot\" and \"MAGAts,\" which are derogatory terms for Trump supporters; furthermore, accusing the group of not spelling Israel correctly. The term \"Zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur that combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This combination is meant to equate Zionists (Jewish people who support a Jewish state) with Nazis, who are known for their violent persecution of Jews. The tweet is therefore classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2215: [1] 1. The use of the term \"ZioNazism\" in this tweet is antisemitic because it combines two historically persecutory tropes: Zionism and Nazism. This term seeks to vilify both Jews and Zionists by associating them with Nazi ideology, a clear manifestation of antisemitic sentiment according to the provided definition. The phrase \"insinuating everywhere\" implies that these elements are prevalent and have negative consequences, which only serves to reinforce and amplify the anti-Semitic rhetoric. Therefore, I would classify this tweet as 1 - antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2216: [1] 1. This tweet, \"@AsaWinstanley @Th2shay The new party The ZioNazi party of great Britain?\", is antisemitic according to the provided definition. It uses the term \"ZioNazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" with a slur that invokes the atrocities of Nazism, implying Jews and Israel are linked to these heinous actions. This statement fits into the list of contemporary examples of antisemitism (Point 9) provided in the definition, where it's explained that using \"classic antisemitism\" to characterize Israel is antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2217: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It contains the antisemitic slur \"zioNazi,\" which is a combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" Using this term is an example of dehumanizing or demonizing Jews collectively.\n",
      "2. The tweet implies that Israel is carrying out a \"Palestinian genocide program,\" a false accusation that has been used to blame Jews for \"why things go wrong\" in the world.\n",
      "3. The use of \"non zioNAZI owned pols\" suggests that there are certain politicians who are not controlled by Jewish or Zionist interests, which is a common antisemitic trope.\n",
      "4. Overall, this tweet perpetuates several stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jews and Israel, and it can be categorized as antisemitic under the given definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2218: [1] 1. This tweet uses the term \"Zionazi,\" which can be considered a slur against Jews and Israel, and therefore can be seen as antisemitic based on our definition. It also implies that certain actions or outcomes are permitted for 'them' (presumably referring to Israel), and not allowed for their perceived enemies. This sentiment can fuel prejudice towards Jews and Israelis and may contribute to a hostile environment, thus aligning with the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2219: [1]  1. The tweet does contain elements that are potentially antisemitic, as it accuses David Lammy of being \"anti-semitic\" and \"supporting apartheid Israel.\" However, it also refers to the individual and country in question as \"zionazis\" and \"apartheid israel,\" which are antisemitic tropes. The use of such terms, even while criticizing another person's behavior, can be seen as endorsing these ideas and thus contributing to an environment where hatred towards Jews and Israel may thrive. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2220: [1] 1. The tweet contains several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism provided: it refers to Israeli citizens as \"zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic term, and calls them \"cowardly\" and \"thieving pigs.\" It also implies a threat (\"One day you'll get yours\") towards Israel or Jewish individuals. All of these factors make this tweet antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2221: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it uses the term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" (a person who supports Israel) with a pejorative slur (\"Nazi\"), to refer to Israeli snipers involved in protests. The combination of these words is meant to demonize and dehumanize Jewish individuals, as \"Nazi\" often evokes images of the Holocaust and antisemitic beliefs from that time period.\n",
      "Row 2222: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. The reason for this classification lies in the use of multiple terms that fall under the definition of antisemitism. Firstly, it accuses David Lammy (a British Member of Parliament) as being an \"anti-semite,\" which directly refers to a perception of Jews that may express hatred toward them. Additionally, by associating him with \"supporting apartheid Israel\" and referring to him as a \"zionazi,\" the tweet further cements its antisemitic nature. These terms are not used to engage in constructive discourse but rather to demonize David Lammy, who is presumably Jewish or non-Jewish individuals who associate with Jews, in this case. Therefore, according to the definition provided, the answer for the given tweet is 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2223: [1] 0. The tweet calls out a specific individual, Maureen Lipman, for allegedly behaving \"like a zionazi.\" This statement is critical towards the person's behavior, rather than expressing hatred or stereotypical assumptions towards Jews as a group. While the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic in itself, it does not make the tweet inherently antisemitic. The primary focus of this tweet seems to be on criticizing Maureen Lipman's actions rather than attacking or stereotyping Jews in general.\n",
      "Row 2224: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it contains multiple points that can be classified as such according to the provided definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The term \"ZioNazi\" used in this tweet is an antisemitic slur, which combines Nazi (a term associated with Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust) with Zionist (refers to a Jewish national movement that supports the reestablishment of a Jewish nation in Israel).\n",
      "2. The phrase \"funds him\" implies that Jews have undue influence on Trump, which is a common antisemitic trope that accuses Jews of secretly controlling political leaders and institutions.\n",
      "3. The statement \"who pray to the cancerous terrorist racist apartheid regime\" is a comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime in South Africa, which can be considered an antisemitic allegation.\n",
      "4. The tweet claims that this behavior goes against Jesus' teachings, thus implying that Judaism and Christianity are fundamentally at odds, which also aligns with several common antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "5. The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" throughout the tweet further reinforces its antisemitic nature.\n",
      "Row 2225: [1] 1. The tweet in question contains the term \"ZioNazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur. It combines two well-known antisemitic tropes: the demonization of Jews as Nazis and the false accusation that they control governments (in this case, the term \"pig\" could be interpreted as a reference to their supposed manipulative nature). As such, it meets several criteria for antisemitism as per the definition provided. The tweet does not criticize or question these tropes but rather reinforces and spreads them, which means it cannot be classified as a call-out of antisemitism but should instead be considered antisemitic itself (1).\n",
      "Row 2226: [1] 1. The term \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic slur that combines \"Zionist\" with \"Nazi.\" Although this tweet is not directly attacking Jewish people, it is using a dehumanizing and derogatory term to criticize someone or a group of people who are associated with Israel. This usage can fuel hatred towards Jews, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism provided. Therefore, I classify this tweet as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2227: [1]  1. This tweet contains multiple elements that align with the definition of antisemitism provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It uses the term \"ZioNazi,\" which is a clear example of hateful rhetoric directed toward Jews.\n",
      "2. It accuses Giuliani of being evil, corrupt, and cowardly while also associating him with Jewish people (a collective demonization).\n",
      "3. The tweet links the idea of corruption to 9/11 by implying that Jewish people were involved in the attacks or their cover-up. This is a classic antisemitic trope that falsely accuses Jews of being responsible for \"why things go wrong.\"\n",
      "4. The tweet ends with a claim that Giuliani is aiding and comforting the ZioNazi enemy, which also associates him with Jewish people and their supposed harmful intentions.\n",

      "Row 2228: [1]  0. This tweet does not meet the criteria of antisemitism, although it contains some antisemitic language like \"ZioNazi\" and references to an alleged Israeli lobby. However, the overall context of the tweet is calling out what the user perceives as a biased response by a TV host on SkyNews regarding accusations of anti-semitism against Jeremy Corbyn's party. The use of antisemitic language may be intended to criticize or mock these alleged biases, rather than promoting hatred towards Jews. Therefore, this tweet is not in itself antisemitic but calls out potential antisemitic behavior of others.\n",
      "Row 2229: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple elements that can be considered antisemitic. Firstly, it uses the term \"zionazi,\" which is a derogatory fusion of the words 'Zionism' and 'Nazi,' implying that Zionists are analogous to Nazis - an antisemitic trope. Secondly, it accuses \"America\" of being guilty of aggression in the Middle East, suggesting that America is acting under the influence or control of Jewish people, which is a classic antisemitic conspiracy theory known as 'dual loyalty.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, mentioning \"lizard-eating Saudi slaves\" is an attempt to dehumanize and demonize Arab and Muslim communities, often used to justify historical oppression.

      "Given these elements, this tweet is classified as 1 (antisemitic) according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2230: [1] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic in nature. While \"zionazi\" is a derogatory term that combines two historically oppressed groups (Jews and African-Americans), the user here appears to be using it sarcastically or rhetorically, rather than with the intention of attacking or demonizing Jewish people. Instead, the tweet seems to be addressing a broader issue of individuals being labeled based on their affiliation or perceived political leanings. The content does not meet any of the 12 criteria for antisemitism outlined in the definition provided. It is important to consider context and intent when determining if a statement is antisemitic or not, as the same word can be used with very different meanings.\n",
      "Row 2231: [1] 0: This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it does not directly target Jews or Judaism with hatred or manifest any form of antisemitism mentioned in the definition. The author is expressing a conspiracy theory that could be applied to any group, without singling out Jewish individuals or organizations. Although the term \"zionazi\" is present within this tweet, it does not appear to be used as an antisemitic slur against Jews. Instead, it seems to be incorporated in the broader context of a conspiracy theory about the influence of a certain political ideology (presumably Zionism) in media and news broadcasts. The inclusion of \"zionazi\" does not inherently make this tweet antisemitic as its overarching theme is related to conspiracy theories rather than anti-Jewish sentiment or hate speech.\n",
      "Row 2232: [1] 0. This tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism as it is using the term \"zionazi\" to call out and criticize two individuals (Netanyahu and Trump) who are being accused of promoting a concept similar to \"Zionazi\" rather than targeting Jews or the Jewish community in general. While \"Zionazi\" itself can be considered an antisemitic term, it is not used in this tweet to express hatred or demonize Jews but to criticize the individuals mentioned, who are in power and making decisions. The intention of the user here does not seem to be to cause harm or promote hatred towards Jews or Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\n",
      "Row 2233: [1] 1. This tweet contains elements that can be considered antisemitic, specifically the use of \"ZioNazis.\" Zionazi is a term that combines Zionism and Nazism to denigrate Jewish people or Israel, which falls under the category of accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew (definition point 5). The other content of the tweet is not necessarily antisemitic on its own; it suggests that citizens should make their own decisions without politicians, which can be seen as a critique of political systems rather than Jews or Israel.

      "Row 2235: [1] 1. The tweet refers to the country of Israel as \"ZioNazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\" into a single word. This is an antisemitic term, as it demonizes and equates Jewish people with Nazism. It is also using classic antisemitism by associating Jews (as Zionists) with Nazi-like actions or beliefs. The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" is a clear attempt to dehumanize and demonize Jewish people, thus fitting the definition of antisemitic speech. Therefore, according to the given definitions, this tweet should be classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2236: [0] 0. This tweet does not seem antisemitic based on the definition provided, as it acknowledges that both Jews and Palestinians have rights and calls out those who label someone a \"Zionazi\" or an \"idiot lib\" for expressing this view. While using terms like \"Zionazi\" can be seen as provocative, in this context the author is using it to highlight the criticism they face rather than endorsing the term itself. The tweet does not engage in hateful speech, demonizing, or dehumanization of Jewish people or Israel. Instead, it calls for empathy and understanding towards both sides.\n",
      "Row 2237: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic, as it criticizes a political family (The Royal Family) for their alleged connections with Zionism and an arms company without targeting Jewish individuals or demonizing the entire Jewish community. Although \"zionazi\" is an offensive term, in this case it is being used to criticize the mentioned family rather than to attack or demonize Jews as a whole.\n",
      "Row 2238: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it contains several elements that could be classified as antisemitic: a) the combination of \"Zio\" and \"Nazi\", which are both slurs against Jews; b) the use of the term \"entity\" to describe Israel in an insulting manner; c) the reference to Satan, which can be associated with demonizing Jews; d) the name \"Satanyahu,\" a mockery that could be interpreted as dehumanizing and demonizing.\n",
      "Row 2239: [1]  1. The tweet uses antisemitic language such as 'zionazis' to refer to Israel or Jewish people, which is a derogatory term combining 'Zionist' with 'Nazi.' This comparison is highly offensive and demonizing towards Jews. It also mentions the 'Endlösung' (final solution), which was the Nazi plan for the extermination of the Jewish people during World War II, further connecting Israel or Jewish people to Nazis and the Holocaust. Additionally, the tweet suggests that there will be a genocide against Palestinians involving gas chambers, replicating another horrific aspect of the Holocaust. This is a dangerous comparison and displays a clear intent to spread hate and antisemitic ideology. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2240: [1] 1. The tweet contains language that is considered antisemitic by the definition provided. Specifically, it uses the term \"zionazi\" which is a derogatory slur that combines 'Zionist' with 'Nazi'. This term is used to attack and demonize Jewish people or those who support the state of Israel. Additionally, the tweet accuses an individual (@umasubyan) of being fake due to their pro-Palestinian stance which could also be interpreted as an attempt to undermine Palestinian activism by suggesting it's inauthentic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of the definition that is relevant here is \"Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust\" where it's said, “denying Jewish people their right to self-determination”. The tweet does not directly deny the Holocaust, but it's using a term associated with denial (Nazi) as a slur against Zionists, thus implying that their claims or actions are false or exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the definition mentions \"applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation.\" The tweet could be seen as applying such a double standard by questioning the authenticity of a pro-Palestinian account based on their stance, while not using similar language towards supporters of other nations or causes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, according to this definition and my analysis of the tweet, I would categorize it as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2241: [1] 1. The tweet refers to \"Zionazis,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is an antisemitic slur, as it equates Zionists (supporters of Israel) with Nazis (notorious for their genocidal campaign against Jews). In this context, the term is being used to attack and demonize individuals associated with Zionism. It is therefore appropriate to classify this tweet as antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2242: [0] 0. The tweet acknowledges the legitimacy of both the Jewish people's right to a homeland (Israel) after the Holocaust and the rights of Palestinians. It is criticizing an extreme viewpoint that calls for destroying Israel or attacking its existence, and also calling out individuals who dismiss the rights of Palestinians. The tweet itself does not display any antisemitic tropes, nor does it attack Jewish people collectively.\n",
      "Row 2243: [1]  0. Although the term \"zionazi\" is antisemitic, this tweet does not target or demonize Jewish individuals or communities but rather criticizes a particular individual for using a derogatory term.

      "Row 2245: [1] 1. The tweet contains an antisemitic term, \"ZioNazi,\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This phrase is used to demonize and attack Jews by falsely associating them with Nazism. It is a classic antisemitic trope that accuses Jews of conspiring against others or controlling events behind the scenes, similar to what Nazis accused Jews of doing in Germany.

This tweet contains multiple antisemitic tropes, such as accusing Israel of being an \"apartheid,\" \"terrorist,\" and \"vile\" regime while using derogatory terms like \"ZioNazi\" and referring to individuals as \"Russian Zionists.\" It also questions the loyalty of these individuals to their own nations, suggesting that they prioritize Israel. By categorizing it under \"#LoveSemites,\" the author seems to be contradicting themselves, but this tweet is ultimately antisemitic because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and negative characterizations of Jews and Israel.\n",

The tweet uses language that is considered antisemitic, specifically by invoking the term \"Zionazi.\" This term combines two derogatory terms: \"zio\" which is a pejorative form of the word \"Zionist,\" and \"Nazi.\" Using such terminology is an example of comparing Israel or Jews to Nazis, which falls under point 11 in the definition provided. Additionally, the use of \"low-life SOB's\" can be perceived as insulting towards individuals associated with the Israeli military (the IDF), further amplifying the negative sentiment directed at the target.

      "Row 2250: [1]  1. The use of the term \"zionazi\" in this tweet can be seen as antisemitic, as it combines two offensive terms: \"Zionist,\" which is often used to disparage Jewish people who support Israel, and \"Nazi,\" which refers to the fascist regime responsible for the Holocaust.

      "Finally, the additional comment about finding Iran on a map seems unrelated and may serve to further insult or belittle the targeted user, but it doesn't directly qualify or disqualify this tweet as antisemitic.

So overall, this tweet contains clear indicators of antisemitic behavior and should be classified as such (1).\n",
      "Row 2254: [1] 1. According to the definition of antisemitism provided and taking into account the context of your examples, this tweet can be considered antisemitic. The phrase \"Zionazi\" is an amalgamation of 'Zionist' and a slur often used against Jewish people ('Nazi'). By using this term to refer to those deemed as cowards, it serves to dehumanize and demonize Jews in the same way historical anti-Semitic rhetoric has done. The combination with an insult (pigs) further escalates the level of offense and hate speech.\n",
      "Row 2255: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user compares Israel and its supporters to various negative terms, including \"ZioNazi,\" \"racist apartheid colonial terrorist regime,\" and \"murdering regime.\" They also accuse these individuals of being \"complicit\" in violence, which fits under some examples of antisemitism given:\n",
      "  1. Accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.\n",
      "  2. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\n",
      "  3. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis.\n",

      "Row 2256: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements as it uses \"ZioNazi\" which is a pejorative term combining \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" and accuses opponents on the Left of being under the control of a Jewish power structure, implying that they are untrustworthy or acting against the best interests of their own country. This fits into the definition of antisemitism as it expresses hatred towards Jews. The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" is also an example of Holocaust denial and accusations of Jewish power, further emphasizing its classification as an antisemitic statement according to the given criteria.\n",
      "Row 2257: [1]  0: This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition. The author does mention \"zionazis\" which can be considered an antisemitic term, but in this context, it appears that they are referencing a past historical conflict between Israel and Palestine rather than attacking or demonizing Jews as a group. They discuss a specific historical event (UN resolution 194) and the challenges faced by America. While there is mention of \"zionazis\" which could be construed negatively, in the context of this tweet, it doesn't seem to be used to target or demean Jews as a whole but rather an adversary group in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore, it does not align with the definition of antisemitic content provided.\n",
      "Row 2258: [1] 1. Based on the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic. It uses the derogatory term \"ZioNazi\" to describe someone who is supporting apartheid and terrorism. The combination of labeling someone as a \"ZioNazi\" and connecting it to support for apartheid and terrorism demonstrates the stereotypical allegations, dehumanization, and demonization of Jews or Israelis as a collective, which falls under the definition of antisemitic behavior.\n",
      "Row 2259: [1] 0. This tweet does not qualify as antisemitic, despite using a potentially antisemitic term (\"zionazi\"). The author of the tweet seems to be criticizing Maureen Lipman's history with the Labour Party rather than attacking Jews or Israel. They are not attributing Jewish characteristics to her or blaming her for any wrongdoing just because she is Jewish or connected to Israel. It's a critique of Lipman's past actions in relation to the Labour Party, not an antisemitic attack on her as a Jew or a supporter of Israel. The rest of the tweet focuses on criticizing the author's opinion about \"cocaine snorting,\" which does not indicate any antisemitic intent either.\n",
      "Row 2260: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements of antisemitism as defined in the provided information:\n",
      "- It uses a combination of \"zionazi\", which is an antisemitic term, and \"greater Israel\", suggesting the idea that Jews are secretly planning for world domination, which is a common antisemitic trope.\n",
      "- It accuses \"the zionazis\" (a group it associates with Jews) of having expansionist ambitions to \"take over\" Africa by joining and subsequently taking control of the African Union (AU). This demonstrates a conspiracy theory about Jews, which is often seen in antisemitic propaganda.\n",
      "- Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2261: [1]  0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic, as it discusses historical events without using demonizing or dehumanizing language towards Jews or Israel. It also acknowledges that the Balfour Declaration sought a small village within Palestine.

      "Row 2262: [1] 1. The tweet contains antisemitic language such as \"ZioNazi\" and \"Zionism is HATE\". These terms are used to demonize Jews and Jewish nationalism (Zionism), which can be considered a form of hatred toward Jews, making it antisemitic according to the provided definition. It also calls for spreading hate towards Arabs and Palestinians, further escalating its antisemitic nature by inciting others to engage in hatred against non-Jewish groups. The use of the word \"foken\" and the phrase \"stick your foken label up your where the sun don't shine\" also dehumanize and demonize individuals based on their Jewish identity, further supporting its classification as antisemitic content (1).\n",
      "Row 2263: [1]  1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided. The tweet contains several elements that fall under the definition: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. It makes a false equivalence between Zionists and Nazis, which is an antisemitic trope.\n",
      "2. It accuses \"Zionist Jews\" of collaborating with Hitler in killing Jews, a baseless and slanderous claim.\n",
      "3. It compares the actions of Israel to those of the Nazis, implying that Israel is behaving like Nazi Germany.\n",
      "4. It alleges that world powers are complicit in Israel's \"killings\" of Palestinians, while also invoking the Holocaust and its victims by mentioning that \"the world was silent then and is silent now.\" This again is a false analogy that seeks to demonize Jews and conflate them with Nazis.\n",
      "5. The use of the term \"pogroms\" is a reference to violent, antisemitic attacks on Jewish communities and invokes historical instances of such violence.\n",

      "Row 2264: [1] 1. The use of the term \"Zionazi\" within the context of this tweet can be considered antisemitic as it is a blending of \"Zionist\" and a slur for Jewish people (\"Nazi\"). It combines the two to create a new, dehumanizing term that targets Jewish individuals or their perceived political beliefs. The use of such language is not only offensive but also falls under the category of accusing Jews collectively of harming humanity, which is one of the aspects of antisemitism according to your definition. Hence, my answer is 1.\n",
      "Row 2265: [1] 1. This tweet contains two components that could be considered antisemitic: 1) The use of \"zionazi,\" which is a blending of the words \"Zionism\" and \"Nazi.\" It combines these terms in a way that implies Jews, or supporters of Israel, are being associated with Nazis. This type of rhetoric has historically been used to dehumanize and demonize Jewish people and can be seen as an antisemitic trope. 2) The reference to \"zionazi gangsters\" could also imply that the speaker believes Jewish people hold an excessive amount of power or control over certain situations, which is another common antisemitic stereotype.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to note that even if a statement criticizes antisemitic behavior or language, it can still be considered antisemitic itself if it unintentionally reinforces harmful stereotypes and tropes about Jewish people. The speaker in this tweet might not intend for their words to harm Jewish individuals, but the use of \"zionazi\" is a term rooted in antisemitism, which is why this tweet is classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 2266: [1] 0. The tweet \"Talking to zionazis is a waste of time\" does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to the provided definition of antisemitism. While the term \"zionazi\" includes the word 'nazi,' which has been used in the past in an antisemitic manner, it's essential to consider its context and intent. In this case, the tweet is not using the term \"zionazi\" as a slur against Jewish people or to express hatred toward them; instead, it is referring to individuals who might hold Zionist views. Although the term \"zionazi\" has connotations with antisemitism, the tweet's intent is not to attack or demonize Jews or Judaism but rather to express frustration or disagreement with those holding specific political beliefs associated with Israel and its government. Thus, while it may not be ideal language, it should be classified as not antisemitic in this context.\n",
      "Row 2267: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic as it uses the term \"zionazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term is typically used to accuse Jews of collectively supporting or being responsible for undesirable actions, in this case, controlling the world. Additionally, the claim that the world is run by a \"mobsters\" group further contributes to an antisemitic narrative that paints Jews as powerful and malevolent conspirators.\n",
      "Row 2268: [1] 1. The tweet refers to the United States' government as supporting the \"ZioNazi\" state of Israel, implying that both entities are equivalent to or synonymous with terrorism. This is a direct comparison between the US and Israel, two nation-states, and applies negative connotations to both of them. However, it especially targets Israel by using the term \"ZioNazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" (a term often used to refer to Jews, or those who support the state of Israel) with \"Nazi\" (associated with a regime known for systematic genocide of Jewish people). This rhetoric is intended to demonize and dehumanize both entities, and by extension, anyone associated with either. Thus, according to the given definition of antisemitism and considering how it targets Jews indirectly while accusing others (the U.S. administration) of supporting terrorism, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2269: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism provided, as it's pointing out antisemitic behavior by others (calling them a \"zionazi\" and accusing them of corruption) rather than promoting or expressing hatred towards Jews or demonizing them itself.\n",
      "Row 2270: [1] 1. The use of the term \"Zionazi\" is considered antisemitic as it combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This fusion attempts to demonize Jewish people by drawing a connection between Jews and the historical atrocities committed by Nazis, which is antisemitic according to the provided definition. Therefore, the tweet can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2271: [1] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic, as it appears to be calling out what the author perceives as an unfair or \"Zionazi\" pressure tactic by another user. Although the term \"Zionazi\" has historical connotations with antisemitism, in this context, it's being used to criticize a specific action (or perceived action) rather than promoting hatred towards Jews or Judaism.\n",
      "Row 2272: [1] 1. The given tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements. It uses the term \"ZioNazis,\" which is a derogatory phrase that combines anti-Semitism with racism, as \"Nazi\" refers to followers of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party. It also implies that only those who support Israel would commit such actions, targeting both Jews and their association with the state of Israel. Therefore, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2273: [0] 1. The tweet contains multiple antisemitic tropes, such as referring to Israel as a \"Zionist entity,\" using the derogatory term \"baby killing Zionazi,\" and ending with the slur \"k!ke.\" These phrases demonstrate hatred towards Jews and are often used in the context of antisemitism. While the author may be referencing other users or individuals who have been accused of being antisemitic, by repeating these tropes they are perpetuating a harmful narrative. Therefore, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 2274: [0] 1. The tweet contains multiple antisemitic slurs (\"baby-killing Zionist\" and \"kike\"). These terms are harmful, dehumanizing, and demonize Jewish individuals or groups. They fall under the definition of antisemitism because they express hatred towards Jews and are not used in any critical context to call out antisemitism, but rather as a means of attacking or demonizing Jewish individuals.\n",
      "Row 2275: [1]  Based on the provided definition of antisemitism and your examples, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1). Here is my reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The tweet uses the term \"Zionazi\", which is an antisemitic slur combining \"Zionist\" with \"Nazi\". This term targets both Jews and Israel by equating them to Nazism, which fits under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "2. The user further reinforces this idea by claiming that \"the racist comments leave little doubt as to whom [Mark Levin's] hate-filled... screeds attract\". This statement implies that Mark Levin and his followers are inherently linked to racism, which can be understood as an antisemitic sentiment.\n",
      "3. The tweet concludes by saying \"the days of white supremacism in the US and Israel/Palestine are waning\", which is a vague, stereotypical accusation implying that Israel (and by extension Jews) support white supremacy. This further supports the classification of this tweet as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2276: [1] 1. The tweet uses the term \"zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic term that combines the words 'zionism' and 'Nazi'. This combination of terms is offensive and inflammatory, as it conflates Zionists (Jewish supporters of Israel) with Nazis (who targeted Jews for genocide).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The tweet also contains the term \"Pogroms,\" which refers to violent attacks against Jewish communities. By associating these attacks with \"Zionazis\" and not explicitly condemning or distancing from such violence, this tweet could be interpreted as endorsing or justifying violence towards Jews or Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The tweet mentions \"World Leaders,\" implying that there is a collective responsibility or complicity of world leaders in these so-called 'Zionazi Pogroms.' This could be seen as promoting conspiracy theories and false narratives about Jewish power and influence over world events, which falls under the definition of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the definition provided, this tweet can be classified as an example of antisemitic content (1).\n",
      "Row 2277: [1] 1. The tweet does contain language and themes that are found in antisemitic discourse, such as using \"Zionazi\" to refer to members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). This term conflates Zionism with Nazism, which is a classic antisemitic trope.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. However, the context in this tweet seems more about expressing dissatisfaction with the actions of the IDF and support for BDS rather than attacking or demonizing Jewish people collectively. Thus, while it may have underlying antisemitic tones, the main intention here appears to be opposition to the politics and actions of a specific state (Israel) rather than an attack on Jews as a group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on this definition and given that we lack direct context outside of these 280 characters, I would classify it as antisemitic (1). However, it is important to acknowledge the nuance in such cases, where a statement may have overlapping dimensions of both anti-Zionism and antisemitism. In this case, my primary reasoning for choosing 1 is based on how \"zionazi\" is used here - conflating Zionism with Nazism, which is a classic antisemitic trope.\n",
      "Row 2278: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between Israel and apartheid, and uses the term \"zionazi\" which is an antisemitic slur. Additionally, referring to Israel as a \"hellhole\" may contribute to the demonization of Jews and Israelis, which is also consistent with the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 2279: [1] 0. The tweet criticizes \"Apartheid Israel\" and refers to its supporters as \"Zionazis,\" which can be seen as antisemitic by some people. However, the tweet is not expressing hatred towards Jews or accusing them of any wrongdoing. Instead, it appears to be criticizing the Israeli government's policies and actions, not attacking Jewish individuals themselves. As a result, it falls under the category that calls out antisemitic behavior without being antisemitic itself.\n",
      "Row 2280: [1] 1. According to the definition provided, the term \"Zionazi\" is an antisemitic term as it combines \"Zionist\" with \"Nazi.\" Although in this specific tweet the user does not use this phrase to attack or demonize Jews, but rather to call out someone else for being pro-Zionazi despite their claims, it can still be considered antisemitic due to the usage of the term itself. This is because the mere inclusion and endorsement of this term in any context could perpetuate and promote negative stereotypes about Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 2281: [1] 1. The tweet contains an antisemitic term, \"ZioNazi,\" which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This phrase has a long history of being used as a slur to vilify Jews and Jewish supporters of Israel. It is often employed to falsely accuse individuals of having undue influence or power due to their Jewishness, which can lead to prejudice and hatred towards them. In this context, the term \"ZioNazi\" serves no purpose other than to incite antisemitic feelings and beliefs. Additionally, by referencing a specific person (Dershowitz) alongside this term, it reinforces the idea that there is some sinister collaboration between Jews and Nazis, further perpetuating antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of such terms in a tweet should not be dismissed simply because they are directed at others or used to criticize someone else's use of similar language.

      "Row 2282: [1] 1. This tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements, as it uses the derogatory term \"ZioNazis\" to refer to Jewish individuals or Israel, and accuses them of causing harm to an American citizen. The use of \"Fxxxxng unbelievable\" further implies frustration with the alleged silence of the US government regarding this issue, suggesting that the tweeter believes Jews have undue influence over the government's actions. Thus, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 2283: [1] 1. This tweet contains several antisemitic tropes and expressions (such as \"ZioNazis\" and the implication that Israel occupies Palestine). It also accuses Zionists of being responsible for the death of a U.S. citizen, which is similar to accusations of Jews for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or non-Jew (point 5 in your definition).

It uses the term \"Zionazis,\" which is a derogatory, antisemitic term that combines \"Zionist\" with a slur for Nazi.

      "Row 2285: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, according to the given definition of antisemitism. The term \"ZioNazi\" is a blend of 'Zionist' and 'Nazi,' which is used to demonize or attack Jewish individuals.

This tweet contains the term \"ZioNazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur that combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It aims to equate Jewish people or Israel with the Nazis, which is a classic antisemitic trope. The context of the tweet suggests that it is used against someone who supports Israel or Zionism, indicating that they are being criticized for their perceived support of Israeli policies.

      "\n",
      "Furthermore, by connecting Trump's purported financial ties to Adelson and AIPAC, the tweet insinuates that Trump is being controlled by Jewish people or supporters of Israel. This implication can be seen as demonizing Jews and presenting them as a malicious force.\n",

      "Moreover, this tweet suggests that Trump's actions (specifically related to Iran sanctions and his COVID-19 response) are influenced solely by Jewish interests, which is a common antisemitic trope that accuses Jewish people of controlling governments and international affairs.

Additionally, it claims that Israel's actions are being backed by Zionists (\"US-backed ZioNazis\"), suggesting a conspiracy and collectively blaming Jews for the political actions of a nation state. It also accuses \"all\" other nations (except Iran) of turning their backs on Palestine, implying that they have allied with Israel and its alleged evil actions. This tweet contains several elements that fall under the definition of antisemitism: comparison to Nazis, blaming Jews for wrongdoing committed by a nation state, and accusations of conspiring against humanity.\n",
      "Row 2297: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements that can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition:\n",

      "2. It claims that \"stealing land, stealing lives, stealing property\" is what \"zionazis do,\" implying a negative stereotype about Jews.\n",

This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains the term \"ZioNazi,\" which is a derogatory and offensive combination of \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It is a hateful term used to attack Jewish people by falsely associating them with fascism and racism. The context of the tweet is also important to consider, as it is attacking someone (possibly referring to Representative John Lewis) for becoming a \"neoliberal ZioNazi thug.\" This accusation suggests that the individual in question has been influenced or controlled by Zionist forces, which aligns with some classic antisemitic tropes. While this tweet does not explicitly target all Jews or Israel as a nation-state, it still employs an antisemitic slur and seeks to vilify someone by falsely accusing them of being influenced by a Zionist agenda.\n",

The term \"Zionazi\" combines anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism, which further indicates hateful intent towards Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 2302: [1]  The tweet \"This Zionazi criminal is the most wanted terrorist on earth.\" can be classified as antisemitic (1).

It accuses an individual of being both a part of the Zionist movement and a criminal, while also equating them with Nazis - a notorious group known for their genocidal actions against Jews. This combination of terms and associations falls under point 3 (\"Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews.\") and point 12 (\"Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\") in the definition provided, thus making it an antisemitic tweet according to the given definition.\n",

      "Row 2392: [0]  This tweet contains multiple issues, but it can be primarily categorized as an antisemitic remark because of the following reason: The statement \"siding with Israel\" is used to criticize Ilhan Omar's religious identity and her political position, which indirectly targets the state of Israel. While the text explicitly refers to \"Israel\" and not the Jewish community per se, it associates Omar's religion (Islam) with a stance favoring Israel and accuses her of being \"fake\". This implies that Jews or Jewishness might be perceived as disloyal or unauthentic, which is a common antisemitic stereotype.\n",

      "However, there are other elements in the tweet that are not necessarily antisemitic but can contribute to an overall negative and dehumanizing tone toward Omar: calling her \"fake\" and suggesting that \"Muslims are ashamed for having you as Muslim.\" These accusations might be aimed at discrediting or belittling Ilhan Omar, rather than specifically targeting the Jewish community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this context, I would classify this tweet as antisemitic (1) because of its association between Omar's religious identity and her perceived position on Israel.

The given tweet contains strong language and expressions of hatred towards \"Israelis\" and people who support them, which is an indication of antisemitic sentiment as it targets a nation based on its majority religion or ethnicity (Judaism). Although it doesn't use explicitly hateful terms against Jews, the focus on hating \"Israelis\" and the exclamation \"fuck Israel\" implies that the author associates being an \"Israeli\" with being Jewish. The tweet is aggressive in nature and promotes hatred towards a group of people based on their nationality or perceived ethnicity. As such, it can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2395: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any language that is demeaning, hateful or stereotypical towards Jews or Judaism.

      "Row 2402: [0] 0. The tweet does not express any hatred or negative sentiment towards Jews or Jewish people but rather criticizes the political actions of a Pakistani leader and his country's stance on certain international relations.

      "\n",
      "1) The tweet calls all Israelis \"Zionists\" and implies a monolithic, negative understanding of Zionism, which may not be representative of everyone's views within the country or those who hold Israeli citizenship. This is an example of dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective (Antisemitic Category 4).\n",
      "2) It also implies that Israel was \"born out of Jewish terrorism,\" which is a negative and unfounded accusation. This accusation targets the existence of the State of Israel, questioning its legitimacy, history, and existence as a nation-state—thus falling into Category 9: Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination.\n",
      "3) Lastly, it ends with \"Long live Palestine!\", which can be seen as supporting those who reject the State of Israel's legitimacy and advocate for its destruction or transformation, hence promoting antisemitism (Category 10: Applying double standards to Israel, not demanded of any other nation).\n",
      "Row 2413: [0]  0. The tweet does not exhibit any of the characteristics mentioned in the definition of antisemitism as it neither expresses hatred towards Jews, targets Jewish individuals or institutions with rhetoric that demonizes or stereotypes Jews, nor promotes the harming of Jews. Rather, it appears to be an expression of frustration and a statement about how difficult it is for some people to understand why Palestinians might harbor animosity toward Israel. It does not engage in any sort of stereotypical vilification or dehumanization that is typical of antisemitic expressions.\n",
      "Row 2414: [1]  0. The tweet does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews or use antisemitic tropes, it merely questions the existence of Israel. While it might be perceived as a criticism of Israel's legitimacy, without additional context and considering that it does not demonize Jewish people collectively or use dehumanizing language, it should not be classified as an example of antisemitism according to this definition.\n",
      "Row 2415: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or rhetoric and it is not accusing Jews as a whole, nor Israel collectively, but rather expresses opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu's policies. The target of criticism here is a specific political figure, not the Jewish people or the state of Israel as a collective entity. Therefore, it does not fit within any of the criteria defined as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2416: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any explicitly antisemitic language or tropes, but instead discusses international military aid and cooperation among different nations. It is mentioning the supply of weapons and systems to Israel along with other countries, which does not necessarily imply antisemitism. The quote \"Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas\" (Everyone Together, Everyone's Progress) from Indian politician Narendra Modi also doesn't suggest any hate towards Jews or Judaism. It would require a context that targets Jews specifically or refers to conspiracies or tropes about the Jewish people to be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2417: [1] 0. The tweet does not directly accuse or demonize Jews or Israelis as a collective group. It expresses solidarity with Palestinians while criticizing the annexation of West Bank and the perceived silencing of criticism against Zionism in mainstream British politics, which is not inherently antisemitic. The author does not use tropes like blaming all Jews or Israel for the actions of a government or claiming that they are collectively responsible for their government's policies. Instead, it focuses on criticizing those who oppose the expression of criticism towards Israeli policies and endorses free speech on this topic. It is essential to distinguish between criticism of political actions by the state of Israel and antisemitic tropes or rhetoric targeting Jews as a group or individual Jews.\n",
      "Row 2418: [1]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition, as it criticizes Israel's actions toward other territories without blaming Jews collectively for these actions. The tweet refers to the acceptance of Israel and its consequences on Palestine, Lebanon, Golan heights in Syria, and terrorism worldwide. While it can be considered critical towards Israel's policies, it does not use any antisemitic tropes or blame Jews as a collective for those issues.\n",
      "Row 2419: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic in itself. It mentions that Pakistanis can visit Jerusalem, and while it refers to \"Israel permits it,\" the information provided does not contain any overtly hateful, dehumanizing, or conspiratorial claims against Jews or Israel.

      "Row 2421: [0]  0. This tweet does not exhibit any elements of antisemitism as defined in the given guidelines. The user mentions \"Israel\" and \"the house of Jacob,\" which are references to biblical terms used for the Jewish people.

This information alone does not demonstrate any intent to harm Jews, demean Jewish people, or question Israel's legitimacy, which are all criteria for antisemitic behavior under your guidelines.\n",
      "Row 2424: [0] 0. This tweet is a quote from the Bible (Isaiah 45:17) and does not contain any antisemitic language or tropes. It refers to Israel as a nation being saved by Yahweh, but it is quoting a religious text and is not promoting hatred towards Jews or demonizing them.\n",
      "Row 2425: [0] 0. This tweet does not accuse all Jews or the Jewish community as a whole of anything negative or blame them for anything wrong. It is discussing how Zionists, an ideology that supports a Jewish state, are handling criticism from other Jews.

It is important to note that while criticism of a nation-state like Israel is not inherently antisemitic, the choice of words used here (especially \"Fuck\") amplifies its negative intent and tone.\n",

This tweet could be considered antisemitic as it draws a direct comparison between Israel and the historical apartheid regime in South Africa, which fits under the definition of antisemitism (e.g., \"Comparing Israel or Jews to the south african apartheid regime.\"). By using this analogy, the author is perpetuating the idea that Israel operates similarly to an oppressive and unjust regime, thus targeting both Jewish and non-Jewish individuals related to Israel and its institutions.\n",
      "Row 2436: [0] 1: The tweet suggests that British and American governments' intentions behind establishing Israel were malevolent and for exploiting Middle Eastern resources, rather than protecting Jews or creating a safe haven for them.

While the tweet does include criticisms of Israel and refers to it as an apartheid state, it does so within the context of discussing Israel-Palestine conflict rather than making accusations directly against Jewish people. The author also addresses perceived inconsistencies in the opinions held by right-wing individuals and provides a counterargument. It is essential not to confuse criticism of Israeli government policies or actions as inherently antisemitic without evidence that the person being critical holds an underlying bias towards Jewish people.\n",

      "Row 2466: [1] 0. The tweet does not specifically target Jews or Jewish individuals with hateful rhetoric or stereotypes, nor does it directly express hatred toward them. Instead, the tweet refers to a faction within the GOP (Republican Party) as \"Zionist.\" While \"Zionist\" is not inherently antisemitic, it can be interpreted as a reference to Jews when used politically in this context.

While this could be debated based on differing opinions about vaccine distribution and politics, it does not explicitly accuse Jews or Israel as a whole of being genocidal or express hatred toward them. However, the use of the term \"genocidal\" may be seen by some as hyperbolic or inflammatory, but it is not inherently antisemitic on its own. It's important to note that while the tweet doesn't meet the definition of antisemitism according to IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) guidelines by directly targeting Jews or Israel as a Jewish collective, it may incite further antisemitic ideas depending on the context and the way it is interpreted. As such, based solely on the content of this tweet without any additional contextual information, it's difficult to definitively classify it as antisemitic (1) or not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2468: [0]  0: This tweet does not contain any antisemitic rhetoric or language, but instead highlights Israel's achievement of vaccinating more than a million people.

The tweet focuses on the issue at hand, which is the distribution and usage of vaccines during the pandemic, rather than targeting Jewish people or Israel's existence as a nation-state with hatred or demonization. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by this framework.\n",
      "Row 2469: [1] 0. Although this tweet criticizes Israeli actions and mentions the concept of \"apartheid,\" it is not accusing all Jews or Israel as a nation-state of being inherently evil or responsible for all wrongdoings.

The author of this tweet does not display hatred toward Jews or blanket condemnations of Judaism or Jewish people as a collective entity. Rather, the critique is directed at the actions and policy decisions made by Israel's governing authorities, which are distinct from its people or their religious beliefs.

      "Row 2471: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under the definition of antisemitism as outlined in your instructions, for several reasons. First, it is critical of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement, rather than supporting or endorsing its aims. The term \"antisemitic\" is used to criticize the movement's ideology and goals, not as an attack on Jews. It even goes so far as labeling BDS supporters as \"pro-ethnic cleansing antisemites,\" which is an argument against these views, rather than promoting them. Therefore, this tweet can be seen as a callout of antisemitic behavior within the context of the BDS movement and thus, not in itself antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2472: [1] 0. This tweet does not express hatred or prejudice towards Jews or Israel but rather discusses the disparity in vaccination rates between countries, specifically citing Israel's progress compared to the US, UK, and Canada.

      "Row 2480: [0] 0. The tweet does not directly use antisemitic language or tropes and is questioning the political affiliation of a specific group (ANTIFA) instead of targeting Jews or Jewish people as a whole.

Hence, my answer would be 0 (not antisemitic) with a note that it is important to remember cultural context and potential unintentional offense when evaluating humor.

Additionally, the user's intent is not clear if they are critiquing Stephen Miller for his potential negative effects on Jews rather than vilifying Jewish people themselves. As a result, this tweet should not be classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2491: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It is referencing another user's Holocaust-related comment and poking fun at a perceived stereotype of older Jews discussing the Holocaust. While it may seem critical towards Jewish individuals, in the context it does not demonize or dehumanize Jews nor does it promote any form of hatred towards them. The tweet is mainly making light of a perceived cultural tendency rather than expressing prejudice against Jewish individuals or Israel.\n",
      "Row 2492: [0] 0. While this tweet may express disagreement with statements made by Rep. Ilhan Omar, it does not contain any language or expressions of hatred towards Jews. It calls for the removal of a politician due to her alleged remarks but does not exhibit antisemitic undertones as defined in the provided guidelines. The tweet is critical of Omar's actions and is directed at her rather than the Jewish community as a whole, which precludes it from being classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2493: [0] 1. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, the tweet is indeed antisemitic. The tweet compares Trump's perceived behavior toward \"Jews who don't support him\" with the actions of the Nazis. This comparison demonizes and dehumanizes Jewish people, portraying them as disloyal due to their religious or ethnic identity, which is a classic antisemitic trope. By invoking this trope, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes and perpetuates antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2494: [0] 0. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic. The author seems to be asserting the idea that Jews having the ability to defend themselves is a new development compared to history and that it upsets some people. While it might contain a generalization or simplification about \"them\", it doesn't target Jews with hatred, nor does it use any of the examples of antisemitic tropes listed in the definition. It could be seen as critical of those who oppose Jewish self-defense rather than being intrinsically antisemitic. However, it should also be noted that this answer is based on the assumption that \"them\" referred to in the tweet is not a reference to Jews or Israel but another group opposing the defense of Jews. If this interpretation was not correct and \"them\" refers to Jews or Israel, then the answer would need to be reassessed. But as it stands now, without explicit hatred towards Jews or any overtly antisemitic tropes, the tweet should be classified as non-antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2495: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic for a few reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It assumes that \"all good brainwashed Muslims\" hate Jews, which is a stereotype and generalization based on religion rather than individual beliefs or actions.\n",
      "2. The mention of \"hate sitting in Congress\" seems to be targeting Jewish members of Congress by implying they are filled with hatred towards others because of their faith.\n",
      "3. Using the term \"kuato,\" which is a slang term from the 1987 film \"Predator,\" can be considered dehumanizing and demonizing, as it implies that the targeted individual (a Jewish person in this case) is evil or dangerous.\n",
      "4. The tweet also appears to promote an anti-Muslim sentiment, which can be seen as another form of bigotry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this tweet exhibits several elements of antisemitism and should be classified as such (1).\n",
      "Row 2496: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or target them directly, but rather critiques the idea of redefining Jewish identity as a nation and the motives behind it. Although some might interpret this critique as antisemitic, in the context of the definition provided, it is more likely to be seen as an attempt to highlight perceived hypocrisy rather than an expression of hatred toward Jews or antagonism towards Jewish people. Therefore, based on the provided definition and examples, the tweet should not be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2497: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic as it humorously refers to a hypothetical scenario, which is unrelated to any genuine anti-Semitic ideas or attitudes towards Jews or Israel.

The content of the tweet is merely a satirical comparison and lacks the serious intentions of promoting hate or discrimination against Jews or Judaism.\n",
      "Row 2498: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It calls attention to an incident where Palestinians uprooted and stole trees that were planted in memory of a terror victim, Ori Ansbacher. The tweet does not demonize or blame Jews collectively for this action, nor does it make dehumanizing, stereotypical, or demonizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. Instead, it highlights an instance of anti-Jewish violence and intolerance that occurred in Israel. While the incident itself is regrettable, the tweet's main focus seems to be on denouncing such actions rather than promoting antisemitic views.\n",
      "Row 2499: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it compares Ben Shapiro to another well-known figure (Diamond and Silk) in a humorous or rhetorical manner rather than targeting Jews or the Jewish community with hatred or stereotypical allegations. The reference to \"Jews\" here is not used to express negative or hateful sentiments towards Jews, but simply refers to Ben Shapiro as an individual of Jewish faith.\n",
      "Row 2500: [0] 0. This tweet does not seem to contain any explicitly antisemitic language or tropes. It mentions Jews alongside Christians and is discussing the actions of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in a historical context.

It does not question the legitimacy, history, existence, or status of Israel as a nation-state or accuse Jews or Israel of wrongdoing. The message criticizes the legal system and its relation to morality in general contexts like the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation, rather than targeting Jews specifically. Therefore, it is not antisemitic according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 2502: [0] 0. This tweet does not fall under any of the categories of antisemitism as defined in this context. It refers to an \"Area Man\" who made a statement against Jewish involvement in elections, and then it criticizes him for engaging in hypocrisy without attributing harmful or stereotypical tropes towards Jews. The tweet does not call for harm against Jews nor does it dehumanize or demonize them. Instead, the focus is on the hypocrisy of the \"Area Man,\" which does not inherently target the Jewish community or Israel in a negative manner.\n",
      "Row 2503: [0] 1. This tweet states that the prosecutor's claims are antisemitic, which implies an understanding of what antisemitism entails and disagreement with the contentions made. The statement also addresses a specific incident (the claim by the prosecutor) and refers to it directly without resorting to the tropes or stereotypes that characterize antisemitic discourse. It does not make any additional claims of its own, nor does it target individuals or groups on the basis of their Jewishness. For these reasons, I would classify this tweet as 0 (not antisemitic). However, do note that your request to annotate tweets based on my role involves me evaluating whether the content of the given tweets themselves exhibit elements of antisemitism according to the definition provided. In other words, if we were to focus solely on the message this tweet is delivering - it's not promoting antisemitic ideas or prejudices.\n",
      "Row 2504: [1] 1. The term \"Dirty Jews\" directly targets Jewish individuals with dehumanizing language and demonization, as it implies they are inherently unclean or immoral due to their religion.

      "Row 2505: [1] 0. This tweet does not display any signs of antisemitism according to the definition provided.

      "Row 2506: [1] 0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the provided definition, as it only mentions someone's upbringing without making any negative or dehumanizing statements about Jews or Jewish people.

      "Row 2507: [0] 0. This tweet does not fit within any of the criteria for antisemitism according to the provided definition. It expresses admiration for Jewish people, stating that they do not beat or abuse their wives (which is a positive remark), and it lacks any elements such as comparing Jews to Nazis, questioning Israel's legitimacy, or blaming Jews collectively for actions of a nation-state. The tweet is praising the moral behavior of Jews, which does not correspond with the definition of antisemitism given.\n",
      "Row 2508: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. It merely discusses a hypothetical demonstration called \"Jews for Concealed Carry\" and asks those interested to DM (Direct Message) the author if they would like to participate.

Instead, it seems to promote a cause that potentially involves Jewish people but is not inherently antagonistic towards them or their identity.\n",
      "Row 2509: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain antisemitic language or promote antisemitic ideas. It is criticizing a simplistic argument often used by Republicans that equates criticism of Israel with hating all Jews, which is not an accurate portrayal of every Jew's opinion on the matter.

      "Row 2510: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any language or tropes that specifically target or demonize Jewish individuals or their institutions, nor does it express hatred toward Jews. It is critical of the White House's stance on Muslims and lack of religious activities, but does not engage in antisemitic rhetoric. This tweet can be considered a criticism towards the White House rather than an expression of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 2511: [0] 0. This tweet calls out antisemitic behavior, as it criticizes the comparison of \"Browns\" to Jews by some fascists, and expresses a desire to stop this behavior.

      "Row 2514: [0] 1. The provided tweet does not directly contain any language or content that is inherently antisemitic. However, it could imply a sense of inconsistency in how @AOC addresses different types of violence based on their perceived impact on her followers. By mentioning the lack of tweets about specific incidents involving attacks on Jews, it implies that if those events were covered by AOC, she would be criticized for not addressing \"other\" forms of violence more frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the provided text does not directly contain any antisemitic tropes or language as described in the definition you've provided, this tweet could be seen as indirectly highlighting a perceived lack of coverage or attention to incidents involving Jewish communities by AOC.

The provided tweet does not contain any language or sentiment that expresses hatred toward Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or their property, the Jewish community, religious facilities, or the state of Israel with rhetorical or physical manifestations of antisemitism as per your definition. The tweet is asking a question to clarify if Representative Tlaib's statement includes Jews, and it doesn't use any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotyping allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective, either.

The given tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic language or rhetoric, and its intention is to inform people about accounts run by Nazis pretending to be Jews, which should be reported.

Therefore, this tweet can be considered as not antisemitic (0) according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2518: [0]  Based on the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet could be classified as potentially antisemitic (1). The context provided in the text— \"This is how they started with the Jews\"—implies a comparison or reference to historical persecution of Jews. This may evoke a sense of fear or apprehension, which might be associated with past atrocities and could thus be interpreted as antisemitic. However, this interpretation could also vary depending on the context in which it was originally posted and further surrounding content within the same thread. Without further context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment; however, the tweet's potential association with historical persecution and its implicit reference to \"the Jews\" should be taken into account when making such determinations.\n",

The individual tweeting \"@DanKravitz4 You�re a disgrace to Jews.  And humans.\" is directly targeting and disparaging DanKravitz based on their Jewish identity. This could cause harm or humiliation, which are components of hatred towards Jews as per the definition of antisemitism provided. Although it does not explicitly compare Israel or Jews to undesirable things or make stereotypical allegations about all Jews, it still uses Jew as a pejorative term, which is considered an act of discrimination and prejudice against Jewish people.

      "Row 2521: [0] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic elements as it accuses Jewish citizens of only being loyal to Israel or other Jews worldwide, which falls under the definition of antisemitism (point 8). It implies that these individuals are disloyal to their own country, thus fostering the idea of a dual loyalty conspiracy. Additionally, by referencing Hitler's statement about Jews not being loyal to the state, it evokes a historical antisemitic trope used by hateful figures throughout history. Therefore, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.\n",

The author of this tweet acknowledges antisemitism they have encountered and hopes that such hateful sentiments are uncommon.

      "Row 2523: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user does not make any comparisons or demonize Jews, but rather critiques a statement made by Trump.

      "Row 2526: [0] 0. According to this definition, it does not appear that the given tweet is antisemitic. It is criticizing an organization (Popular Front) for their perceived obsession with certain individuals or groups, including Jews.

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it acknowledges the historical significance of the Holy Land for both Jews and Muslims without utilizing any antisemitic tropes or language typically associated with hatred towards Jews.

This tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it does not target Jews or Israel with hatred, stereotypes, or demonization, nor does it attempt to blame them for real or imagined wrongdoings.

      "Row 2538: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the given definition because it contains several elements of antisemitism. Firstly, it falsely accuses Jews (collectively) of funding Hitler and propagating anti-Semitism while being involved in it themselves. This is a classic antisemitic trope that casts Jews as being responsible for their own oppression. Additionally, the use of \"Burning candle both Ends Either way You WIN\" implies that Jews cannot escape blame regardless of what they do, which further aligns with stereotypical portrayals of Jews as cunning and manipulative. The tweet is thus antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2539: [0]  1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, primarily due to its use of misinformation and stereotyping. It falsely accuses Jews of wanting a nation in their \"ancestral home\" based on a religious text (Koran) that does not belong to them. The Koran is associated with Islam, not Judaism. This type of misrepresentation fuels prejudice against Jewish people and can be seen as an attempt to demonize or dehumanize them.

      "Row 2546: [0] 1: This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it equates the attack on Muslims in New Delhi with the pogrom of Jews carried out by the Nazis, specifically referring to the Kristallnacht. Such a comparison is inappropriate and tends to devalue the unique and horrific experiences of Jews during the Holocaust. It also risks causing further distress to those who have experienced similar attacks or loss.

The tweet does not contain any of the key aspects of antisemitism defined in your criteria, such as comparing Israel or Jews to the apartheid regime, questioning Israel's legitimacy, dehumanizing Jews, etc. Instead, it simply refers to a piece of literature being authored by Jewish individuals. While there are instances where referring to \"Jewish\" writers can be seen as an antisemitic remark when used in a negative or degrading manner, this tweet does not seem to fit into the described definition of antisemitism.

      "Row 2552: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic due to its use of tropes, such as accusing \"Omar\" (presumably Representative Ilhan Omar) of having radical rhetoric towards Israel, Jews, and America in general. The reference to a \"cultural Jihad\" perpetuated by her also aligns with historical antisemitic narratives that portray Jews as foreign forces seeking to undermine the values and societies they live within. Furthermore, it claims that Democrats who defend Omar are aligned with \"Islam,\" which is another common antisemitic trope of conflating Jews and Muslims as monolithic entities with opposing ideologies. Finally, the statement \"America is no place for either Omar nor the Democrat Party's alliance with Islam\" implies a rejection of both Omar and anyone who supports her, based on her perceived connection to Islam. This tweet ultimately serves to delegitimize Omar and those who stand by her, using antisemitic tropes and stereotypes to do so.\n",
      "Row 2553: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or promote antisemitic ideas itself. Instead, it shares a personal experience of witnessing the effects of historical misconceptions (that Jews \"killed Jesus\") on people's beliefs and actions.

      "Row 2556: [0] This tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it contains a combination of elements that promote hate and stereotypes against Jews. The phrase \"Old which hunts down Jews\" might be a reference to the government or authorities in certain countries, but when combined with the mention of a \"fake virus,\" it could evoke antisemitic tropes associated with conspiracy theories about Jewish control over global events (like spreading disease).

This connection to antisemitism is enough to label this tweet as 1, despite not explicitly naming or targeting Jews.\n",
      "Row 2557: [0]  Based on the provided definition and context, this tweet is antisemitic. The tweet falsely claims that \"we Jews\" (implicitly meaning all Jewish people) control \"most governments,\" which is a stereotype often found in antisemitic propaganda.

Additionally, it refers to another individual, Ana Navarro, as \"a literal Nazi.\" This comparison is a clear association of Nazism or its ideology, thus implying that the person being compared may also be perpetuating such bigotry, which is an accusation that can often be associated with antisemitic tropes.\n",

This is a dangerous path towards antisemitic rhetoric, even if it might not have been the intended outcome of the author of the tweet.

      "Row 2574: [0] 1. The tweet is antisemitic because it targets British Jews specifically and implies that they should not have a voice or opinion on matters. This suggests that Jewish opinions are not valued or taken seriously, which falls under the definition of dehumanizing and demonizing Jews as a collective group (definition point 4). The tweet also shows contempt towards specific groups, such as Corbyn supporters and Guardian readers, who are associated with antisemitism in this case.

This tweet is discussing statements and actions made by Representative Ilhan Omar that have been perceived as antisemitic, such as accusing American Jews of dual loyalty, claiming Israel has \"hypnotized\" America, being endorsed by anti-Semite David Duke, and tweeting \"it's all about the Benjamins\" in reference to Jewish people. The tweet then points out that she supports sanctions on Israel but not on Iran, implying inconsistency or a biased stance against Israel. Although the tweet itself does not contain explicitly antisemitic language, it discusses and critiques Ilhan Omar's actions and statements which have been widely considered as antisemitic.

However, the content of the tweet does not explicitly promote any antisemitic tropes, nor does it make dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective or their power.

      "1. Since the tweet could be seen as expressing concern over a specific instance involving threats made against Jewish individuals and condemning violent behavior, rather than promoting any antisemitic tropes, I would lean towards classifying this tweet as potentially antisemitic (1).

The author doesn't express hatred or prejudice towards Jews nor do they use any stereotypical allegations against them.

This comparison is a clear reference to classic antisemitism that accuses Jews of controlling governments and influencing policy negatively.\n",
      "2. The tweet claims that American Jews have been \"suckered\" by Democrats, implying that the loyalty or interests of American Jews are not genuine and suggesting they were manipulated into supporting certain policies.

      "Row 2638: [0] 1. The use of \"you so idolize?\" suggests that the tweet is referring to individuals who hold an admiration for certain aspects or figures related to Jewish history, particularly in reference to their role during the Holocaust.

Although it may not be necessary to distinguish between the two groups in this specific case, the tweet itself is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2642: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its use of stereotypical allegations about Jews (e.g., accusing them of \"fleeing\" from places where they were loved and tolerated, and implying that their departure was a result of intolerance towards the Jewish community from non-Jewish populations). The tweet also blames Arabic Jews for being Islamophobic, which is another stereotypical allegation often associated with antisemitism. It misrepresents historical events and facts by claiming that Jewish extermination and exodus from Arab lands were due to intolerance from the local populations towards the Jewish community, rather than acknowledging complex sociopolitical factors at play during those times.\n",
      "Row 2643: [0]  1. The tweet states that the user believes Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib retweeted a message containing an \"antisemitic blood libel,\" which is a longstanding antisemitic trope accusing Jews of ritual murder, such as the kidnapping and killing of children. This claim in the tweet suggests a belief that Rashida Tlaib is endorsing or propagating an antisemitic idea, even though she later \"undid\" (unretweeted) it. It's essential to note that even if the content was not originally retweeted by her but shared within the same context in which she might have seen it, the tweet can still be considered antisemitic based on the user's characterization of the situation.

This type of questioning can lead to dehumanizing and demonizing allegations against Jews or the power of Jews as collective, which are red flags for antisemitism. It's also worth noting that the tweet does not directly criticize Sephardic Jews for seeking refuge in a Muslim country but rather insinuates something negative about it by implying they were \"kicked out\" from their previous location and then asking why they sought refuge in another.

      "Row 2676: [0] 0. The given tweet does not fit the definition of antisemitism as it is not expressing hatred towards Jews or targeting them or their property, religious institutions or the state of Israel negatively. It is a question asking why some people might hold negative views towards Jews and Arabs, but it is not making any accusations or stereotypes about Jewish individuals or communities. It does not contain any classic antisemitic tropes mentioned in the definition provided.

      "- The phrase \"Fakestinians\" is used, which denies the legitimacy and existence of Palestine as a nation, which falls under point 9 of the definition (denying Jewish people their right to self-determination).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- It suggests that there can never be peace between Israelis and \"Fakestinians,\" implying an inherent conflict between Jews and Palestinians, which may fuel further hatred towards either side. This perpetuates negative stereotypes and beliefs, aligning with point 4 (making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective).\n",

Therefore, it can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2679: [0] 1. The provided tweet contains an antisemitic element as it falsely equates Judaism with Nazism and implies that the Holocaust, in which six million Jewish people were murdered, was somehow justified by Hitler's claim to be a Christian. This perpetuates a common antisemitic myth that Jews are collectively responsible for Jesus' death. The tweet also denies the reality of the Holocaust and diminishes its significance by using it as an example of propaganda.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, because it falsely equates Judaism with Nazism, implies that the Holocaust was somehow justified, and denies the reality and severity of the Holocaust.\n",
      "Row 2680: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any hateful or discriminatory content against Jews. Instead, it appears to be a neutral historical fact shared in the context of Easter celebrations. The user is referencing an event that took place between the Romans and the Jews during that time without any current implications on Jewish people. As such, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism based on our definition.\n",
      "Row 2681: [0] 1. Based on the definition provided, this tweet could be considered antisemitic due to its content implying that Jews were responsible for the slave trade, which is a classic antisemitic trope. This falls under point number 5 of the list: \"Accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.\" The tweet cites historical and dehumanizing allegations about Jews in relation to the slave trade, thus perpetuating antisemitic narratives.\n",
      "Row 2682: [0] 1. The tweet makes generalized claims about British Jews, implying that all of them would support or condone violent actions carried out by the Islamic State. This is a form of stereotypical allegation and demonization, as it portrays Jewish individuals in a negative light without evidence or context. Additionally, the reference to the Islamic State is an attempt to dehumanize or connect Jews with a group that has committed atrocities.

      "The provided tweet is antisemitic because it makes two significant points that are indicative of antisemitism. Firstly, the statement \"You hate Jews & Israel\" directly targets a group of individuals (Jews) and their nation-state (Israel). This accusation, without evidence or context, suggests malicious intent on the part of the person being addressed. Secondly, the mentioning of 9/11 and suggesting that it wasn't Jews who were responsible for the tragedy is a common antisemitic trope known as \"blood libel\". It wrongfully accuses Jews of causing harm to non-Jews or being involved in nefarious activities, further perpetuating hatred and prejudice.

      "Row 2688: [0]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes, comparisons to apartheid, questioning the legitimacy of Israel, or blaming Jews collectively for actions of a nation state.

      "Row 2691: [0] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it equates not being left-wing with being a \"racist\" or a \"Nazi\". It implies that anyone who is not on the far left is comparable to Nazis, which is a dangerous and ignorant statement. Moreover, it wrongly connects opposition to Trump supporters with antisemitism. While the tweet does not directly mention Jews or Israel, its underlying message of equating political ideologies with historical hatred and oppression can be perceived as perpetuating antisemitic tropes.\n",
      "Row 2692: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any language or content that demonizes, stereotypes or shows hatred towards Jews. Instead, it expresses concern about the rise of antisemitism and highlights the importance of remembering Holocaust victims, including 6M Jews murdered by Nazis in WW2. Additionally, the tweet supports Israel as a Jewish state, which is not an inherently antisemitic position but rather a demonstration of support for a nation state established to provide safety and security for its citizens who are predominantly of Jewish heritage.\n",
      "Row 2693: [0] 0. This tweet does not directly target or demonize Jews but rather sarcastically comments on the concept of \"unfettered state power\" being beneficial to Jewish communities throughout history.

It can be considered as criticism towards those who believe in an absolute authority without pointing blame at Jews themselves.

Instead, it calls out a specific case involving the use of offensive terms (\"LITTLE JEWS\" and \"IN THE BLOOD\") by an individual who appears to have been involved in a guardianship proceeding at VCAT (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal). The tweet highlights what it perceives as a double standard or hypocrisy on the part of the tribunal member, which led to the daughters being suspended from caring for their loved one. Although the terms used in this case are offensive, the overall intention of the tweet is not to attack or demonize Jews but rather to critique the actions and decision-making process of the VCAT member and the hypocrisy involved in such a situation.

      "Row 2695: [0] 1. This tweet contains antisemitic elements, such as using the phrase \"filth against the Jews,\" which is demonizing and dehumanizing language towards Jewish people. It also inaccurately claims that Poland destroyed a large portion of Polish Jewry (the Holocaust was carried out mostly by Nazi Germany, not Poland), further propagating historical falsehoods. The mention of a perceived \"left/Islamic alliance\" is often used to suggest that left-wing and Muslim individuals are working together against Jews, which can be seen as an antisemitic trope. Additionally, referring to Bernie Sanders as \"Bernie the Pole\" misrepresents his ethnicity (Sanders' father was born in Poland but Sanders himself identifies as Jewish and not Polish). Overall, this tweet demonstrates a lack of understanding and empathy towards Jewish people, which can be considered antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2696: [1]  0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or hatred towards Jews.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with another individual's intentions and behavior, specifically pointing out that they seem to be using a discussion as an opportunity to criticize Israel and Jews rather than engaging in good faith about the topic at hand. However, no explicit hatred, blame, or dehumanization towards Jewish individuals is present. The tweet can be interpreted as calling out bad-faith arguments against Israel or Jews, rather than targeting Jews themselves.\n",
      "Row 2703: [1]  1. This tweet contains an antisemitic element by referencing a religious text (Quran 5:21) to justify a specific geopolitical stance towards Jews and the land of Israel, which can be perceived as blaming Jews for their historical situation. The reference to God's conditions and the disobedience of the Jews indicates an antisemitic trope often used in hate speech against Jewish people.

It also blames him for harboring hatred towards Jews and Israel, which is an example of accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew (item 5 from the definition). The tweet targets Chomsky's perceived Jewishness to criticize his stance on Israel, implying that all critiques against Israel are motivated by hatred towards Jews.

Instead, it is critical of a news network (NBC) for seemingly endorsing violence against Jews, which implies that the person who wrote the tweet believes NBC should be held accountable rather than the Jewish community themselves. While the tweet does reference \"the Jews,\" it is in the context of expressing disapproval toward alleged violence committed against them, not attributing blame to all Jews or promoting antisemitic stereotypes.

      "Row 2720: [0] 0: This tweet does not explicitly contain any antisemitic tropes or rhetoric. It implies that societies that persecuted Jews have ultimately destroyed themselves, and it attributes this destruction to the presence of anti-Semitism rather than blaming the Jewish population.

Thus, based on the criteria provided for determining antisemitism, I have classified this tweet as not being antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2723: [0] 1. The tweet is antisemitic because it attempts to minimize the Holocaust by comparing and claiming that the Nazis killed more people from other ethnic groups, specifically mentioning \"Black people.\" This is a common antisemitic trope that seeks to undermine the horrors of the Holocaust solely experienced by Jews. By bringing up non-Jewish victims and making it seem as if their deaths are being overlooked, the author implicitly denies the unique suffering and significance of the Holocaust for Jewish people.

The tweet does not express hatred or prejudice towards Jews, nor does it use any of the common antisemitic tropes mentioned in the definition provided. Instead, it seems to be a neutral observation about how different aspects of an individual's identity might inform their work.\n",
      "Row 2726: [0] 1. This tweet could be considered antisemitic for several reasons. Firstly, it perpetuates the stereotype of Democrats hating Jews, which can fuel prejudice and hatred toward Jewish people. Secondly, the use of \"nearly as much\" implies that there is a hierarchy of oppression, where both black people and Jews are oppressed by Democrats but in different degrees. This comparison can be seen as minimizing the struggles faced by the Jewish community or implying they should not be as upset due to other groups suffering more. Additionally, the last part of the tweet (\"I don't know when these groups will learn\") seems to imply that both Jewish people and black people should be more understanding about their treatment, which can be seen as a dismissal of the legitimate concerns and experiences of these communities.\n",
      "Row 2727: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to this definition because it remembers the 6 million Jews and others killed by the Nazis, promotes solidarity against prejudice, racism, and hatred of the other, and acknowledges the importance of Holocaust Memorial Day.

      "Row 2728: [1] 1. The tweet, \"@Angel5Christine @DwitterWitz Just like the Jews in NAZI Germany!\" is antisemitic according to the definition you provided.

This comparison trivializes the genocide experienced by Jewish people under Nazi rule while also inciting hatred towards the individuals mentioned in the tweet.\n",
      "Row 2729: [0]  0. The tweet expresses a desire to speak out against racism, including anti-Semitism, using the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising as an example of resistance against evil. Although it refers to itself as a Jew and speaks about a Jewish historical event, it does not exhibit any antisemitic tropes or intentions. Instead, it promotes unity in combating racism and calls for standing up against anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice. It is therefore not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 2730: [0]  1. This tweet contains several elements that may be perceived as antisemitic, particularly in the context of a broader discussion on antisemitism. Firstly, it uses an overt generalization about Jews (\"Israeli Jews\") to make a point about reproduction rates within the Hindu community. By doing so, the tweet implies that all Israeli Jews adhere to certain reproductive standards or expectations. This can be seen as stereotyping and essentializing Jewish people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it draws a parallel between Indian Hindus and Jews by suggesting that both groups should \"counter-breed 4 kids\" (or have more children). Although the comparison could be interpreted in different ways, it may also be read as implying that certain characteristics attributed to one group (in this case, Jews) are inherently positive and should be emulated by others. This kind of comparison can lead to reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the tweet's reference to \"insider polygamous islamic harem\" could be seen as a dog-whistle for antisemitism.

Thus, the tweet can be classified as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 2732: [0] 0. While this tweet refers to historical events involving Jews and Nazi Germany, it does not express hatred or prejudice toward Jewish people. Instead, the tweet appears to be reflecting on the difficulties faced by Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.

      "Row 2733: [0] 1. This tweet is not directly antisemitic as it is referencing a past historical event, the Holocaust, and does not contain any language that demonizes or dehumanizes Jews. However, it might be seen as provocative due to its mention of \"literal genocide\" and the reference to the Holocaust in response to someone who opposes a House resolution against antisemitism.

This is a form of antisemitism as it perpetuates negative stereotypes about Jews and seeks to discredit the person based on their perceived ethnicity.

      "1. It accuses Jews, a religious and ethnic group, with harming another group (Palestinians). This perpetuates a harmful stereotype of Jews being responsible for wrongdoings.\n",
      "2. The tweet makes use of dehumanizing allegations about Jews by implying they're killing Palestinians.\n",

While the tweet refers to \"Chasidic Jews,\" it is not making any claims about their actions being inherently negative or antisemitic in nature. The focus of the tweet is on contrasting the perceived behavior of Chasidic Jews with another group of people, rather than expressing hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities.\n",
      "Row 2771: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit any of the defined characteristics or manifestations of antisemitism as per the definition provided. The text highlights a demographic aspect in Israel and makes a comparison to the United States, without targeting Jews or Jewish institutions specifically, nor expressing hatred towards them. It is not utilizing common antisemitic tropes, such as conspiracy theories about Jewish power or control, nor does it demonize or dehumanize Jews or Israel. Furthermore, it does not question the legitimacy, existence, or status of Israel as a nation-state nor does it call for harming or targeting any person or group due to their religion or nationality.

This tweet does not contain any antisemitic tropes or language that demonize, stereotype, or hold the entire Jewish population responsible for political actions or world issues.

It is a critique of a potential YouTube video that targets all Jews, which can be perceived as problematic or unjust.

This tweet is antisemitic because it references the \"blood and soil\" chant, which is a Nazi slogan used in the 1930s to promote an ideology of nationalism that emphasized racial purity and the territorial control of ethnic Germans. The phrase \"Jews will not replace us,\" also directly refers to white supremacist and antisemitic beliefs, indicating a clear intent to spread hateful rhetoric against Jews and those who support them. Furthermore, the mention of Trump's comments about the crowd is a direct reference to his defense of white nationalists during the Charlottesville protest, where he infamously stated that there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" This statement not only defends but also normalizes racism and antisemitism.

      "Row 2787: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it contains a stereotypical allegation about the relationship between Arabs and Jews, as well as an overt reference to religion in a way that promotes religious conflict. It implies a sense of animosity and opposition between these two groups, which may provoke hatred or harm towards Jewish individuals or their institutions. The phrase \"The banner of Islam against the Jews will now be entirely the responsibility of the non-Jews.\" is particularly concerning as it perpetuates negative tropes about Jewish-Muslim relations and can potentially incite conflict between these communities.\n",

      "Row 2804: [0] 0. This tweet does not appear to contain any overt antisemitic content or language, and it is instead focused on expressing support for the President, emphasizing unity across different religious groups, and expressing confidence in the future despite perceived opposition from the left. Although it could be argued that the phrase \"4Christians,Jews, Protestants, Catholics\" might be interpreted as a simplistic representation of diverse groups rather than an endorsement of their individual interests or identities, the overall tone and message of the tweet do not align with any of the definitions of antisemitism outlined.\n",

The tweet does not directly attack or demonize Jews or Judaism; it is rather addressing another user, specifically DeSeanJackson10, questioning his beliefs about Jewish and Black people being sub-human, which is a reference to the historical and ongoing issue of white supremacy and racial prejudice in America. The tweet is not utilizing classic antisemitic tropes or accusing Jews or Israel collectively for actions or events.

      "Row 2813: [0]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it repeatedly claims that the remaining Jews in Yemen are about to be \"ethnically cleansed.\" The phrase \"ethnically cleansed\" is often associated with genocide and is used in this context to create fear and demonize Jewish people.

      "Row 2816: [1]  Based on the definition of antisemitism provided and the examples given, I would classify this tweet as antisemitic (1). This is because the content of the tweet involves blaming Jews for an event in history, specifically mentioning them taking part in the Wola massacre. Such accusations fall under the category of assigning collective responsibility to all Jewish people for real or imagined wrongdoings committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. This is a key element of antisemitism and would lead me to consider this tweet as such.\n",

It acknowledges that there are differing opinions among Jewish people when it comes to Zionism, and although it disagrees with the user's opinion by labeling them as \"racist\", it does not accuse all Jews of having this viewpoint nor make any dehumanizing or demonizing remarks. The tweet is critical of a specific individual's beliefs rather than targeting Jewish people in general.\n",

      "Row 2821: [1]  0. This tweet calls for the freedom of Palestine, which is a political stance and not inherently antisemitic. It acknowledges the existence of both Palestinian Christians and Jews, implying inclusivity rather than exclusionary or hateful beliefs.

This tweet is not antisemitic, as it criticizes the term \"Judeo-Christian\" by pointing out its flaws and implications, such as promoting Islamophobia, eliding Christian oppression of Jews over centuries, and ignoring Jewish civilization worldwide and key Jewish developments in Middle East and North Africa.

This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it uses a racist narrative to distinguish between \"modern white Jews\" and \"biblical Hebrews.\" It implies that modern Jews are not \"real\" or true followers of Judaism based on their race and skin color. Furthermore, the author suggests a hierarchy among different ethnicities, which is a classic antisemitic trope often used to demonize and dehumanize Jewish people. The author's claims about \"melanin levels\" being responsible for intelligence or morality also perpetuate harmful stereotypes commonly associated with antisemitism.\n",

      "Row 2828: [0]  1. This tweet is antisemitic because it uses a historical analogy involving Jews and Nazi Germany, which is inherently dehumanizing and demonizing. The author of the tweet implies that people who do not support their viewpoint will be led to slaughter like the Jews in Germany during the Holocaust. By making such an extreme comparison, this tweet promotes antisemitic ideas and stereotypes about Jewish people.\n",
      "Row 2829: [0] 0. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews or make any stereotypical allegations about them, but rather compares the treatment of Jewish victims in WW2 to the treatment of Hindu victims at the hands of Islamic invaders.

The tweet is criticizing the exclusionary practices of a group rather than expressing hatred towards Jewish people.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Firstly, it accuses George Soros of being complicit with the Nazi regime during WWII. This is a well-known antisemitic trope that blames Jews for the Holocaust or suggests that they collaborated with the Nazis.\n",
      "- Secondly, the tweet claims that Soros is providing financial support to groups that commit violence against Jews, which is untrue and further perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish control of finances and their influence on politics.\n",
      "- Lastly, the phrase \"useful idiots\" is a derogatory term associated with Stalin's regime, but it is used in this context to insult those who oppose Soros or criticize his actions.

Instead, it points out a perceived issue within the Democratic Party and suggests that when Jewish organizations don't speak up against certain statements about Jews, those behaviors may continue.

The given tweet does not use any stereotypical or dehumanizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective and it does not accuse Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. It rather criticizes Communism's targeting of Jews, which is not a manifestation of antisemitism according to this definition, as it doesn't express hatred towards Jews. The tweet's author even encourages the reader to learn more about history by recommending they read a book, which seems to be an attempt at educating and not inciting or perpetuating hatred against Jews or Israel. Hence, the tweet is not antisemitic in nature based on this definition.\n",
      "Row 2834: [1]  1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the given definition because it equates all Jews with \"the real nazis,\" a statement that not only demonizes Jews but also misrepresents and trivializes the atrocities committed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Additionally, this tweet promotes prejudicial ideas about Jewish people collectively being responsible for something (in this case, being \"the real nazis\").\n",

This tweet is not antisemitic in itself, although it refers to the Governor of Illinois being Jewish and the use of the phrase on a sign directed at him, which may be seen as an indirect reference to the Auschwitz context.

The tweet seems to be asking a rhetorical question, expressing confusion about why people are bringing up Kamala Harris' record related to Israel in connection with her Jewish connections.

This tweet questions the historical narrative around the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Solomon's Temple, and it does not express hatred toward Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions explicitly. The user is critically examining the historical claims made by both sides, questioning why Jews are considered \"invaders and occupiers\" while there have been two mosques built on what was believed to be the location of Solomon's Temple.

      "Row 2841: [1] 1. This tweet contains an antisemitic comparison between Jews and a food item (roast chicken), which is often employed to dehumanize and demonize Jews. By equating Jews with something as mundane as \"roast chicken\", the tweeter trivializes the horrors of the Holocaust, making light of the systematic murder of millions of people because they were Jewish. This comparison also serves to reinforce a stereotype that Jews are fundamentally different from other humans and not deserving of equal rights or dignity, which is a key characteristic of antisemitism.

Specifically, this tweet falsely claims that \"Jews wrote the protocols,\" referencing \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" a notorious antisemitic forgery that fabricates a conspiracy by influential Jews to achieve world domination through subversion and revolution.

Firstly, it uses the term \"Jews\" to attribute negative qualities (in this case, making something of poor quality) to an entire group of people, which falls under stereotyping and demonizing Jews as a collective. Secondly, it does not criticize the content or nature of the thing referred to as \"trash,\" but rather attributes its creation to all Jews, implying that the actions of individuals from this religious or ethnic background are representative of their entire group.

      "Row 2898: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic due to its use of conspiracy theories, which are common in antisemitic discourse. The tweet falsely accuses Soros of denying his Jewish heritage and collaborating with Nazis, even though there is no evidence to support these claims. It also implies that Soros's wealth was obtained through immoral means associated with the Holocaust, which further demonstrates antisemitic intent.

The tweet's target is the misguided belief of certain individuals about the racial identity of Jewish people, not the Jewish community as a whole or individual Jews.\n",
      "Row 2924: [0] 0. This tweet calls out Bernie Sanders for allegedly failing his Jewish constituents and criticizes him for his perceived lack of support for the state of Israel. Although the tweet contains references to historical events involving Jews, it is not expressing hatred or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews collectively. Instead, it is critical towards Bernie Sanders' stance on Israel-related issues, rather than targeting Jewish people as a whole. Therefore, according to the given definition, this tweet should be considered not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 2925: [0] 1. The tweet contains a reference to the Holocaust, specifically the claim that Jews \"should have just complied\" and not be thrown in ovens. This comparison is deeply antisemitic as it equates criticism or dissent among Jews with collective culpability for historical atrocities committed against them. It also dehumanizes Jews by suggesting they are unworthy of protection. Additionally, the tweet extends this rhetoric to other groups (Washington and Vietnamese) but the main target is clear: Jews. Therefore, it can be classified as antisemitic.\n",

      "Row 2930: [0] 1. This tweet appears to be antisemitic for several reasons. First, it asserts that \"Jews\" are using a Nigerian activist (Aisha Yesufu) to destroy Islam in Nigeria. By portraying Jews as malevolent actors manipulating another individual or group, the tweet echoes common antisemitic tropes of Jewish control and power. Additionally, it implies that Aisha Yesufu is not acting independently or according to her own beliefs or principles, but rather is being controlled by a supposedly secretive and malignant \"Jewish\" influence. This type of conspiracy theory often serves as a cover for antisemitic ideas and can incite hatred towards Jews.

      "Row 2931: [0]  Based on your definition of antisemitism and the classification guidelines provided, this particular tweet should be classified as 0. Although the term \"zionist hater\" contains a reference to an ideology associated with Jewish people, it is not used in a hateful manner towards them or to promote hatred or stereotypes about Jews.

      "Row 2935: [1]  1. According to the definition of antisemitism provided, this statement can be considered antisemitic due to its use of stereotypes and broad generalizations about Jewish people.

      "Furthermore, the mention of \"sacraficing Jews since Kaztner!\" appears to make reference to a historical event during World War II, in which Jewish refugees were sacrificed under dubious circumstances, leading to controversy and debate on its legitimacy or necessity.

      "Row 2991: [0] 0. This tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism, as it discusses ethnic origins and family relationships between different groups of people but does not exhibit any hateful or dehumanizing language against Jews or Israel. While it might not be entirely accurate from a genetic perspective (as many Jews have Middle Eastern ancestry), it's not expressing hatred towards them and is more focused on disputing the tweet that referred to \"Cave Dwellers\" as being separate from whites/Jews. However, it's essential to note that this does not necessarily mean that this person has no prejudices or may not post antisemitic content in the future. They might simply be engaging with a previous user's tweet without expressing their own hateful beliefs against Jews or Israel.\n",

It is pointing out that just because something is \"the law,\" it doesn't make it right or good, and questions who writes and enforces laws. The examples given (Jews, Roma, LGBTQ+ people, and the disabled) were all victims of oppression during Nazi Germany.

Firstly, the claim that \"quite a lot of them (referring to Jews) are very anti-white indeed\" is stereotypical and demonizing towards Jewish individuals.

It points out an issue with how Orthodox Jews have been treated amid a contagious disease outbreak (likely referring to the COVID-19 pandemic), criticizing society for blaming them without providing adequate support and communication in their language. While it might be perceived by some as critical of Jewish communities, it is not using antisemitic tropes or stereotypes to denigrate Jews.

This tweet is not antisemitic because although it refers to the historical context and actions of Adolf Hitler, it does not promote antisemitic views nor blame Jews for their persecution.

This conversation is not targeting Jewish individuals or institutions in a harmful or stereotypical way.\n",
      "Row 3018: [0] 0. The tweet is not antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it calls out someone for having issues with \"Asians and Jews\" without expressing any hatred or prejudice towards Jewish people themselves. Although the tweet uses a term \"Jews,\" it does so to critique the user mentioned in the tweet, rather than demonizing or stereotyping the entire Jewish community. It is simply pointing out that the person has issues with two different ethnic and religious groups: Asians and Jews.

Thus, it is not antisemitic according to the provided definition.\n",
      "Row 3024: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition because it is criticizing and questioning statements made by a specific individual without targeting Jewish individuals or their institutions directly.

The comparison being made between the hypothetical president's actions towards Native Americans and Hispanics is not inherently antisemitic. It is critical of the hypothetical president, but it does not engage in the targeted hatred or rhetoric towards Jewish people that would constitute antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 3026: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it uses the term \"Jew\" with negative implications, associating it with betrayal or snitching, which is a common antisemitic stereotype.

This tweet does not contain any explicit or implicit expressions of hatred toward Jews, nor does it target Jewish individuals or institutions with rhetorical or physical manifestations of antisemitism. It simply references a novel and compares the tactics used by the Nazis to those employed in present times. The comparison itself is not inherently antisemitic; rather, it expresses concern about current trends that may be reminiscent of historical events. Therefore, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",

This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or language, as it is asking for the opinion of \"British Jews\" on a political figure and their potential influence without making any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.

      "Row 3032: [0]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it references and implies support for the actions of the Nazis against Jews. By suggesting that India should follow the example set by the Nazis, this statement demonstrates an endorsement of antisemitism and hateful ideologies, which would make this tweet fall under the definition of antisemitism provided. This statement is not a mere critique or discussion about historical events but rather a call for replicating actions that targeted Jews specifically for their ethnicity, which are key characteristics of antisemitic ideology.\n",

      "Row 3035: [0] 1. The tweet refers to an individual who is generously allowing that not all Jews cause antisemitism, implying that there might be a perception that Jews as a collective are responsible for it.

Thus, it could be considered as leaning towards antisemitic (1) rather than overtly so. However, your classification system allows for 0 if it doesn't contain explicit, overt antisemitic content that targets Jews or Jewish communities directly. In this case, while there is a potentially problematic underlying sentiment, the tweet doesn't directly target Jews or use explicitly derogatory language against them, which might justify classifying it as 0 (not antisemitic) under your guidelines. But from an overall perspective of the content and context, it would be safer to classify it as mildly antisemitic (1). The subtle endorsement of an antisemitic trope (Jews being responsible for antisemitism) is a cause for concern.\n",

      "Row 3118: [0] 1. The statement \"Found a guy on here claiming that the Jews did 9/11\" is referencing an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which claims that Jews were responsible for the September 11 attacks. This type of allegation falls under the category of accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew (point #5 in the definition), and thus can be considered as antisemitic content.\n",
      "Row 3119: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic, as it acknowledges that Jews and Israel support a strong relationship between the United States and their own goals for peace. It does not promote any hatred or conspiratorial ideas about Jewish people or Israel, but rather states they share similar aspirations to others in society.\n",
      "Row 3120: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic. It highlights the religious connection between Christianity and Judaism by reminding people that Jesus was a Jew, and emphasizes the importance of understanding Jewish traditions and history within Christian beliefs.

      "Row 3121: [0]  1. This tweet compares those who have received a COVID-19 vaccine (referred to as \"the vaxxed\") with Nazis, and it further equates this group to oppressive forces of the past. It also uses antisemitic tropes by positioning those who are not vaccinated in the role of Jews. In doing so, it employs a classic antisemitic motif that has been historically used to demonize and blame Jewish people for various societal problems. The tweet is thus antisemitic as it seeks to dehumanize and target a group by likening them to Nazis and Jews, which falls under the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 3122: [0] 0. While the tweet criticizes and uses derogatory language toward an individual at Fox News, it does not target or promote hatred towards Jews as a group.

      "Row 3123: [0] 0: This tweet does not fit any of the listed criteria for antisemitism, and although it contains references to historical events (the Holocaust) and historical figures (Hitler), it is not comparing these aspects to Jews or Israelis, nor is it accusing Jews of supporting Nazis or Aurangazeb. The tweet criticizes people who defend Aurangzeb rather than Jews or Israel, so it's more about the behavior of those being criticized than an attack on Jewish individuals or groups.\n",
      "Row 3124: [0]  0. This tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the definition provided. The user is discussing their examples, and while it is not clear from this single statement what the context of the conversation may be, they specifically mention that \"only my first example was Jews.\" They go on to provide a historical perspective by stating they were referring to Eastern Christians, Heretics, and Protestants. While it's essential always to consider the broader conversation and any previous statements for full context, this single tweet does not seem to contain antisemitic rhetoric or hatred towards Jewish people based on the given definition.\n",
      "Row 3125: [0]  0. This tweet is not antisemitic because it does not express hatred towards Jews or target Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it criticizes a specific interpretation of Torah and the practices in ancient times, without attacking Jews collectively. It also seeks evidence from the Christian Church and historical sources to back up their argument, which indicates openness to fact-based discussion rather than spreading hateful rhetoric.\n",
      "Row 3126: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the given definition, as it is critical of Josh Mandel's alignment with Mike Flynn and disagrees with his stance, rather than making accusations or generalizations about Jewish people as a group.

It mentions that unlike many liberal Jews, President Trump actually has Jewish grandchildren, implying a connection with Israel or Judaism through his family. While it does refer to \"liberal Jews\", this reference alone is not sufficient to classify the tweet as antisemitic, especially when acknowledging Trump's familial connections to Judaism. Furthermore, the tweet praises President Trump for being the best President for Israel, which seems to be a complimentary statement and not an expression of hatred towards Jews or Israel.\n",
      "Row 3129: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic according to the provided definition, as it does not express hatred towards Jews or perpetuate any stereotypical allegations about them. The user is simply expressing confusion regarding the timeline of Jewish existence in relation to Jesus Christ. It doesn't use classic antisemitism tropes or imply blame for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew, nor does it deny the Holocaust. Although the context might be related to religion and history, the overall sentiment of this tweet is not hateful towards Jews or Israel, hence it should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 3130: [0] 0. This tweet is not antisemitic because it uses humor, rather than expressing hatred or stereotypical allegations against Jews. It employs hyperbole to make a point about personal choice and responsibility without attacking or demonizing Jewish people. The comparison made between the user's hypothetical situation and that of Jews in the Holocaust is absurd and meant for humor, not to convey any form of antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 3131: [0]  0. This tweet criticizes the misinformation and dangerous ideas presented by @briebriejoy, emphasizing that Jews have standing to be as angry at Nazis as Black people do.

      "Row 3133: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic because it references and compares a past historical event where Jews were persecuted (the Holocaust) to an implied intention of rounding up Jews again, which is both dehumanizing and demonizing towards Jews. By associating the treatment of Jews with the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, this tweet promotes hatred and prejudice towards Jewish individuals, thus falling under the definition of antisemitism provided.\n",
      "Row 3134: [0] 1. This tweet is antisemitic, as it directly references a violent act committed against a Jewish place of worship (Tree of Life synagogue) and uses the term \"All Jews Must Die,\" which clearly expresses hatred toward Jews.

As such, it is important to recognize this as an instance of antisemitic behavior and promote action against it in all its forms.\n",

      "Row 3136: [0] 0. This tweet does not contain any antisemitic language, tropes, or attitudes towards Jews. Instead, it discusses a perceived difference in worldviews between Christians and Jews, specifically regarding the concepts of heaven and hell and their approach to matters on earth. While it may unintentionally oversimplify religious beliefs, it is not attacking, demonizing, or stereotyping Jews or Judaism in any way. Thus, it falls under the category of tweets that call out specific behaviors or ideas but are themselves not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3137: [0]  0. This tweet does not express hatred or prejudice toward Jews or Judaism. Instead, it criticizes a specific family (the Sacklers, who own The New York Times) for their coverage of Israel and accuses them of having influence on US Jews' attitudes towards the country. While there is some criticism towards Jews regarding their perceived lack of concern for Israel, this tweet does not use antisemitic language or tropes. It primarily addresses a specific family and their alleged impact on Jewish views on Israel, without generalizing these observations to all Jews or Judaism. Therefore, it cannot be considered as expressing antisemitism within the given context.\n",
      "Row 3138: [0] 0. The tweet does not contain any antisemitic rhetoric or tropes. It is stating a historical fact about the treatment of religious minorities in Pakistan, including Jews, and expressing concern for Shias' well-being.

The given tweet contains elements that can be perceived as antisemitic, specifically the use of the terms \"Jews\" in conjunction with negative language and the generalization to all Jews through the words \"all.\" It also appears to target a specific journalist (Jean Guerrero) by implying she is hateful toward Jewish people. This is problematic because it accuses an individual, who may not be Jewish, of holding animosity towards a whole group based on their actions or beliefs, which falls under the category of antisemitic manifestations. However, since the tweet does not explicitly use classic antisemitic tropes such as \"killing Jesus\" or \"blood libel,\" it doesn't fall squarely under item 9 on your provided list.

Instead, it critiques the double standard in media coverage of radicalism across different religions and points out that certain events tend to be associated with Jewish or Christian individuals only when they become \"terrible, bizarre, slanderous, and unavoidable.\" It is critical of media bias rather than expressing hatred towards Jews or promoting stereotypes.

Additionally, it targets Jews by blaming them collectively for the politics of a nation-state. This is in line with definitions of antisemitism as it includes dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. The reference to \"the Rothschilds\" further reinforces this, as the Rothschild family is often used in antisemitic conspiracies. Therefore, this tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the definition provided.\n",
      "Row 3183: [1] 1. The tweet contains two elements that could be considered antisemitic: labeling someone as a \"ZioNazi\" and attributing a violent statement about killing idol worshippers (including Christians) to the Torah. While not all uses of the term \"ZioNazi\" are inherently antisemitic, in this context it is used in a negative and derogatory manner towards Jews. Additionally, falsely accusing Judaism's sacred text, the Torah, of advocating for violence against non-Jewish populations (including Christians) could also be perceived as an antisemitic statement. Although the tweet criticizes this misinformation, it still contains these antisemitic tropes and thus should be classified as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 3184: [1]  1. This tweet contains the term \"Zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur that combines \"Zionist\" with the term \"Nazi.\" The author uses this term to describe Abe, implying that he supports Zionism in a similar way Nazis supported their ideology. This comparison between Israel/Zionism and the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime is an example of antisemitism. It targets not just Abe, but also Jewish people in general by linking their beliefs to the violent and oppressive actions associated with Nazism. This tweet is therefore considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 3185: [1] 1. The tweet \"RT @Max_Gross: @CatPurry9 Abe is just your typical garden variety Zionazi\" uses the term \"Zionazi.\" This term combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" which are both historically negative terms. In this context, it implies that someone is both a Zionist (a person who supports the idea of a Jewish homeland in Israel) and a Nazi, which is an antisemitic group responsible for the Holocaust. Therefore, by conflating these two groups, the tweet is making an antisemitic comparison. Hence, it can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 3186: [1] 0. While the term \"ZioNazi\" is antisemitic, the tweet itself does not seem to express hatred towards Jews or target them for harm or demonization. Instead, it criticizes the use of the word \"antisemitic\" in reference to calls for justice and equality. The statement that it's \"ZioNazi 101\" is being used to critique the idea of labeling as antisemitic those who advocate for fairness and balance, rather than expressing hatred towards Jews themselves. Therefore, this tweet can be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 3187: [1] 1. This tweet accuses Israel of being an apartheid state and refers to its supporters as \"Zionazis.\" This is considered antisemitic as it aligns with several points in the definition you've provided, specifically: 1) targeting Israel or Jews as a collective, 8) applying double standards to Israel that are not applied to any other nation, and 9) denying Jewish people their right to self-determination. The tweet's language is hostile and demonizing towards both the state of Israel and its supporters, which fits the criteria for antisemitism.\n",
      "Row 3188: [1]  1. This tweet contains an antisemitic slur (\"ZioNazi\") directed towards a person, implying that they are a Jewish extremist or someone who is excessively loyal to Israel due to their being Jewish. The use of this term is hateful and demonstrates animosity toward the individual based on their perceived religion. Additionally, it aligns with definition 3: \"Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews.\" The attacker is wishing ill-will onto the target because of their implied Jewish identity. So, despite not expressly criticizing Israel's government or actions, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic based on its abusive nature and intent to provoke negative emotions towards a person due to their religious affiliation.\n",
      "Row 3189: [1] Based on the provided definition of antisemitism, this particular tweet could be seen as an instance of calling out or highlighting an instance of potential antisemitism. The term \"Zionazi\" is a fusion of the words 'Zionist' and 'Nazi,' which has been used as a derogatory and hateful term against Jewish people who are associated with or support the state of Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in this case, the tweet appears to be referencing an article from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) using the handle @wsj by saying \"Zionazi style.\" While the term \"Zionazi\" itself is antisemitic, it's being used here as a critique of The Wall Street Journal rather than directly targeting Jewish people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, according to the definition and rules given, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0). This is because the tweet does not exhibit any intention or action aimed at perpetuating hatred towards Jews; it's instead a critique of what might be perceived by the author as an unfair or biased article about Israel.\n",
      "Row 3190: [0] 0. This tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior or language but instead complains about being called a \"zionazi.\" While \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, it is in this case not used to attack or demonize Jews. The author of the tweet is expressing frustration and not promoting hatred towards Jews. Therefore, according to our definition of antisemitism, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3191: [1]  1. The tweet contains multiple elements of antisemitism, including the use of \"Zionazi\" and the accusation that \"America is ruled by Zionazi scum.\" This term combines two historically and currently hateful terms: \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" It portrays Jews as a collective group controlling America, which aligns with the antisemitic stereotype of Jews conspiring to harm humanity. As such, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3192: [1] 1. This tweet contains several antisemitic elements according to the provided definition of antisemitism: it uses the derogatory terms \"ZioNazi's\" and \"sellout slaves,\" and it expresses a strong hatred towards Jews through insulting language and the support of the BDS movement, which frequently employs antisemitic rhetoric. Therefore, this tweet can be considered as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3193: [1] 1. The tweet appears to contain several antisemitic elements, including the use of the term \"Zionazi\" and the allegation that Zionists (Jewish Israelis) are terrorists and responsible for alleged Israeli crimes against Palestinians. It also seems to promote the BDS movement, which can be an outlet for antisemitism as well. Therefore, according to the given definition of antisemitism, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 3194: [1] 0. This tweet calls out the author's hatred towards \"zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic term. However, it does not demonize or attack Jews collectively; instead, it expresses a general dislike of individuals who hold extreme Zionist views and supports their actions. The primary focus in this tweet is on criticizing President Trump for supporting these individuals rather than attacking Jews as a whole or accusing them of wrongdoing. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3195: [1]  1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between Israel and the term \"Zionazi,\" which is an antisemitic slur that combines the words \"Zionist\" (a person who supports Zionism or Israel) with the word \"Nazi.\" Additionally, referring to Golan as being \"illegally occupied by Zionazis\" is also antisemitic. This tweet targets Jews and their alleged power through collective blame for an occupation.\n",
      "Row 3196: [1] 1. According to the definition provided, this tweet can be considered antisemitic because it contains an antisemitic slur (\"zionazi\") directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals. The term \"zionazi\" combines two highly offensive and disparaging terms - \"Zionist,\" a person who supports the ideology of Zionism, and \"Nazi,\" referring to followers of Adolf Hitler's far-right movement in 1930s Germany known for their antisemitic views and actions. The intent behind this slur is clearly to target Jews or those perceived as supportive of Israel, which can be considered an attack on a specific group.\n",
      "Row 3197: [1]  1. The use of \"ZioNazis\" combines two antisemitic tropes: \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" The term is used to demonize Jewish people and their connection to Israel by implying that they are like Nazis. This tweet, therefore, could be considered as antisemitic based on the criteria provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 3198: [1] 0. While this tweet contains an antisemitic term \"Zionazi,\" it does not use this word to attack or demonize Jews, but rather as a way of reacting to another user's comment. The tweet is not antisemitic in itself because it does not express hatred towards Jews, nor target them or their community institutions and religious facilities. Instead, the author seems to be using \"Zionazi\" to call out the use of an offensive term by the other person, suggesting that the latter has engaged in anti-Semitism. Therefore, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3199: [1] 0. Although the term \"zionazi\" is inherently antisemitic, it's not being used in this instance to demonize or harm Jews. The tweet doesn't target Jewish individuals or institutions but instead criticizes Twitter for what it perceives as its management by people holding pro-Israel views. This critique might be perceived as unfair or incorrect, but it is not directed towards Jews or their collective responsibility. Hence, according to our definition of antisemitism and the context of this tweet, it does not qualify as antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3200: [1]  1. This tweet uses the term \"zionazis,\" which is a derogatory term combining \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This term has been historically used as an antisemitic slur against Jews, comparing them to Nazis. In this case, the tweet refers to the Zionists in a negative context (\"zionazis\"), thus it can be considered antisemitic based on its use of this derogatory phrase.\n",
      "Row 3201: [1]  1. The term \"Zionazis\" is an antisemitic slur that combines \"Zionist,\" a political affiliation, with a pejorative and offensive term for a Nazi. It implies the user believes all Zionists are as evil or dangerous as Nazis. This association of Israel, as a state and by extension its Jewish citizens, to Nazis is antisemitic. Furthermore, \"arming\" and \"financing\" the \"Zionazis\" suggests that the United States is supporting something harmful, again associating Israel with harm and evil, which is antisemitic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 3202: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic, as it contains a comparison between \"Zionazi\" (a term with clear anti-Semitic connotations) and the USA's foreign policy choices. The use of \"Zionazis,\" which combines a derogatory term for Jews (\"Nazi\") with the term \"Zionist,\" is a form of antisemitism as it conflates Jewish identity and political views (in this case, support for Israel) with Nazi-era atrocities. By accusing the United States of financing and arming \"Zionazis,\" the author is perpetuating the stereotype that Jews control and manipulate global politics to their advantage. Therefore, the tweet is categorized as antisemitic based on the given definition.\n",
      "Row 3203: [1] 1. The tweet \"This feature will be quite helpful for ZioNazis.\" contains an antisemitic term, \"ZioNazi,\" which combines the words 'Zionist' and 'Nazi.' In this context, it is being used to stereotype and demonize Jewish or Israeli individuals. This aligns with point 3 in the definition of antisemitism as it makes a dehumanizing and demonizing allegation about Jews by grouping them with Nazis, which is an extreme form of hatred towards Jews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 3204: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements of antisemitism as defined in the guidelines. It uses the term \"ZioNazis,\" which combines two notorious historical atrocities (Nazism and Zionism) and implies that Jews, or Israel, are comparable to Nazis - a classic antisemitic trope. Furthermore, it implies that no matter what happens, it will not appease the alleged \"ZioNazis,\" implying a sense of irrationality and intransigence typically ascribed to Jews in classic antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some may argue that this tweet is merely criticizing an action or policy of Israel, the use of such incendiary language clearly crosses the line into hate speech and should be considered as a form of antisemitism. The term \"ZioNazi\" directly targets Jews, whether they are citizens of Israel or not, by implying that their actions can be reduced to the malicious acts of Nazi Germany. This is why the tweet falls under the category of antisemitic language and should be marked as such.\n",
      "Row 3205: [1] 1. The tweet contains multiple antisemitic elements according to the provided definition: It calls Israeli settlers \"invaders,\" uses the derogatory term \"Zionazis\" (which combines \"zionist\" and \"Nazi\"), and includes hashtags that perpetuate anti-Israel sentiment, such as \"#IsraeliCrimes\" and \"#ApartheidIsrael.\" These elements are consistent with various points of the definition you provided. They target Israel and Israeli individuals or institutions, question Israel's legitimacy and existence, compare it to an apartheid regime, apply a double standard to it, and use classic antisemitism (claiming that all Jews and Israel are responsible for actions carried out by the state).

      "Row 3206: [1] 1. The use of \"Zionazi\" in this tweet is antisemitic, as it combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" implying that those who support Israel are similar to Nazis. This rhetorical device is commonly used to spread hatred toward Jews and Zionists and should be classified as an antisemitic statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the term \"#Israel\" at the end of the tweet does not alter the overall meaning or intent of the message. The hashtag is still referring to the state of Israel, and by doing so, it further supports the idea that the tweet is indeed antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3207: [1]  0. The tweet criticizes the IDF and mentions \"zionazis,\" which is an antisemitic term. However, it does not attack or demonize Jews or Jewish individuals; rather, it seems to be addressing a political issue related to Israel and its military force (the IDF). Thus, although the tweet includes an antisemitic slur, it is not in itself promoting hatred toward Jews, but is targeting the IDF for its actions. As such, according to this definition of antisemitism, this tweet should be classified as not antisemitic (0).\n",
      "Row 3208: [1] 1. This tweet is antisemitic according to the definition provided, as it contains a blatant antisemitic term (\"zionazi\") and implies that Jews or Israel are responsible for creating concentration camps, which is a clear dehumanizing and demonizing allegation. This tweet not only employs an antisemitic term but also uses it to attack a specific group of people, thus it falls under the category of 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 3209: [1]  1. This tweet uses the terms \"zionazi\" and \"pogrom,\" both of which have historically antisemitic connotations. A \"zionazi\" is a derogatory term that combines \"Zionist\" with \"Nazi,\" implying that Zionists are comparable to Nazis. This term has been used in the past to vilify and demonize Jews, and its usage can be considered antisemitic. Additionally, a \"pogrom\" refers to violent attacks on Jewish communities. By using this word in the context of a \"zionazi pogrom,\" it implies that a group of Zionists (which are often conflated with all Jews) is carrying out or supporting violent actions against another group. This can be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes and perpetuating antisemitic tropes, thus classifying this tweet as 1 (antisemitic).\n",
      "Row 3210: [1] 1. This tweet contains several elements that could be seen as antisemitic. First, the term \"Zionazism\" combines two concepts: Zionism and Nazism, which is often used to accuse Jews of being similar to Nazis or supporting a state similar to Nazi Germany. Secondly, the tweet accuses U.S. government employees and NATO as agents for Israeli interests, implying that the Jewish people (through their alleged control over Israel) are manipulating international affairs through these institutions. This conspiracy theory can be seen as a contemporary example of antisemitism described in point 4 of your definition (\"Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective\"). It is also reminiscent of point 5 (\"Accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew\"). The use of the term \"R.Murdoch_Rothschild\" suggests an antisemitic conspiracy theory, as it combines the names of two prominent non-Jewish individuals with the Rothschild family, one of the most famous and historically persecuted Jewish families. This part is also indicative of point 5 (\"Accusing Jews or Israel of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew\").\n",

It combines two disparaging terms - \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\" - to accuse Jews collectively of being responsible for the politics of a nation state. While the tweet doesn't explicitly target all Jewish people, it does use language that is meant to demean and vilify Israel and its Jewish population. As such, according to my definition of antisemitism, this tweet should be considered antisemitic (1).\n",
      "Row 3212: [1] 1. The use of the term \"Zionazi\" in this tweet can be considered antisemitic because it combines two historically negative terms, \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" implying that Bernie is both a supporter of Israel (Zionist) and an advocate for Nazi ideology. This association with Nazism is not accurate or fair towards Bernie nor towards the Jewish community as a whole. The term \"Zionazi\" is frequently used to demonize Zionists, Israel, and Jews in general, often by blaming them collectively for the politics of a nation state. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic content according to the given definition.\n",
      "Row 3213: [1] 1. This tweet contains several antisemitic elements: using \"Zionazist\" as a derogatory term for Jews, claiming that the US Constitution is influenced by Judaism in a negative way (as \"expert on Zionazist Judaism\"), and referring to Jews as having invented Nazis. This tweet promotes hatred towards Jews and can be seen as an attack on them. Therefore, according to the definition provided, this tweet is antisemitic.\n",
      "Row 3214: [1] 1. This tweet can be considered antisemitic because it uses the term \"Zionazis\" to refer to Jews, which is a slur combining \"zionist\" and the derogatory term \"Nazi.\" This combination associates Jews with Nazism, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and promoting hatred toward Jews.

While \"zionazi\" is an antisemitic term, in this context it is used critically against other individuals rather than being directed towards Jews or Jewish people as a whole. The tweet expresses disagreement with those who label Corbyn as anti-Semitic and accuses them of being the real racists, thereby not falling into the definition of antisemitism.\n",

      "Row 3229: [1] 1. The tweet contains several elements that fall under antisemitism, such as the use of \"Zionazi\" which combines the words \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi.\" This is an antisemitic term, as it accuses Jews collectively for the actions of a nation state (Israel) by equating Zionists with Nazis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It also uses the hashtag \"#BDS,\" which stands for \"Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions.\" The use of BDS is often associated with antisemitic rhetoric because it frequently targets Israel and its Jewish population rather than merely expressing dissent against its policies or governmental actions.\n",
      "\n",

      "Row 3231: [1] 1. The use of the term \"ZioNazi\" in the tweet is problematic because it combines two highly offensive words, \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi\", to attack or demean Jewish people or Israel. This combination creates an accusation that Jews are responsible for the actions of Nazis, which is a common antisemitic trope. Additionally, the word \"management\" implies that the author perceives a significant amount of control by Zionists over the area in question, suggesting they believe Jews to be manipulative or controlling.

      "Row 3232: [1] 1. The tweet uses the term \"zionazi\", which combines \"Zionist\" and \"Nazi,\" both of which are loaded and have negative connotations. Zionism is a movement advocating for Jewish self-determination in a national homeland, specifically Israel. Nazi is an abbreviation for the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party), a political party that was responsible for the Holocaust and other atrocities against Jews during World War II.

This particular context does not involve antisemitic tropes or intent and thus, doesn't qualify as an instance of antisemitism.\n",
