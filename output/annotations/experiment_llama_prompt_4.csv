This is a classic example of how anti-Jewish sentiment has been used throughout history to demonize and dehumanize the Jewish people. The tweet also suggests that Omar's political views are influenced by CAIR, which is an organization that advocates for the rights of Muslims in the United States but does not represent all Jews or their interests. This can be seen as a double standard applied to Omar and Israel, where she is held accountable for her actions while Israel is not. Overall, this tweet contains several examples of antisemitism, including dehumanizing statements, blaming Jews for the wrongdoings of others, and applying double standards to Israel."""

It specifically mentions Israelis, Ultra Orthodox, Jewish Institutions and Synagogues, as well as Hamas and the Ayatollahs. It does not imply that all Jews are responsible for these events.\n2) The tweet makes no dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as a collective. In fact, it acknowledges that there is a diverse group of people who support BLM and also expresses concern about those Jewish groups and institutions being targeted. \n3) The tweet does not accuse any individual Jew or non-Jew of exaggerating the Holocaust or deny the existence of the state of Israel. It specifically mentions ""Israelis, The Ultra Orthodox, Jewish Institutions & Synagogues"" as well as Hamas and the Ayatollahs being targets.\n4) The tweet does not deny Jews their right to self-determination or accuse them of being loyal only to Israel or Jews worldwide. It specifically mentions groups within Israel that may be targeted due to their political views, which do not necessarily reflect the views of all Jewish people. \n5) There is no classic antisemitism in the tweet (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel). It specifically refers to Israel being targeted by Hamas and the Ayatollahs, as well as certain groups within Israel being targets due to their political views. \n6) The tweet does not apply double standards to Israel that are not demanded of any other nation. It specifically mentions BLM supporters as being antagonistic toward Jews and Jewish institutions and acknowledges the danger this poses to those groups. \nIn conclusion, I would say that while the tweet expresses concern about certain groups within Israel being targeted due to their political views or associations with Hamas and the Ayatollahs, it does not contain any antisemitic statements or allegations based on classic anti-Semitism.'"

I'm glad to have it on hand. Now, let's get back to our task at hand - checking if tweets are antisemitic or not. For this particular tweet, I would say that it is antisemitic. Here's why: \n1. This tweet accuses Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. This is classic anti-Semitism, which is defined in the third item on your list (see #10).\n2. It also compares Jews to Nazis, as per number 11 of your list, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel is antisemitic. This tweet does precisely this.\n3. Finally, it accuses Christians of being complicit in the Holocaust while remaining silent and turning a blind eye. This is an example of classic anti-Semitism (see #8) as well as the charge that Jews are responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew (see #1).\nBased on these three criteria, I would say that this tweet is antisemitic."""

Just you racist, bigoted orange assh*les?","content=""[INST]: You are Llama, an expert on Antisemitism working as a Tweet-Annotator, tasked with checking if tweets are antisemitic or not. You use the following definition of antisemitism:\nAntisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Antisemitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\nContemporary examples of antisemitism include:\n1. Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews.\n2. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective.\n3. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew.\n4. Denying the holocaust.\n5. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust.\n6. Accusing Jewish citizens of being only loyal to Israel or Jews worldwide.\n7. Denying Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.\n8. Applying double standards to Israel, that are not demanded of any other nation.\n9. Using classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel.\n10. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis.\n11. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\nNow I want you to tell me, if the following tweet is antisemitic according to this definition. Please answer 1 if it is and 0 if it's not. Do not explain your reasoning. Use only the specified booleans for your answer. This is the tweet I want you to take a look at:\nAs Lenny Bruce would insightfully ask: You want me and the Kikes to go back? My neighbors the W*ps, Sp*cs, M*cks, P*locks, Ch*nks, and N*ggers too?

Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews. 2. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. 3. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. 4. Denying the holocaust. 5. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust. 6. Accusing Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. 7. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel. 8. Comparing Jews or Israel to Nazis. 9. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\nIn this case, the tweet does not meet any of these conditions and therefore is likely not antisemitic according to the given definition."""

Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities. Antisemitism might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. \nContemporary examples of antisemitism include: 1. Calling for or justifying the harming of Jews. 2. Making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews or the power of Jews as collective. 3. Accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. 4. Denying the holocaust. 5. Accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust. 6. Accusing Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. 7. Using classic antisemitism (e.g.,claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel. 8. Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. [/INST]\nBased on this definition, the tweet is NOT antisemitic. This is because it does not meet any of the criteria mentioned in the definition. It does not express hatred toward Jews or make dehumanizing allegations about them, nor does it accuse the Jewish people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jew or Non-Jew. Furthermore, there is no claim that Israel is a racist endeavor or that they exaggerate the Holocaust. The tweet simply suggests that if Israel existed earlier in time, more Jews would have been saved during WW2 and asks why it took so long for them to be established as a state. This does not imply any anti-Semitism or blame toward the Jewish people specifically, but rather a critique of the delay in establishing Israel as a state.'"

However, I can give you some information that may help you make a better assessment. According to your definition of antisemitism, the first sentence in the tweet could be interpreted as suggesting that Jews are collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel, which is not supported by historical or factual evidence and is a common anti-Semitic trope. Additionally, the use of the hashtag ""#WhoKnew"" may suggest that the author believes there are certain groups who do not belong in the city, which could be interpreted as exclusionary and discriminatory against those groups. However, without more information about the tweet or the context in which it was posted, it is difficult to say for sure whether it is antisemitic or not.'"
